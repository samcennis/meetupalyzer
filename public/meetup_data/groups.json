IBM will provide services and runtimes into the ecosystem based on our extensive software portfolio\nBluemix: Making a difference in the cloud\nWhen IBM envisioned Bluemix, we envisioned a system which would answer the needs and challenges facing developers while at the same time empowering and enabling businesses to leverage their resources in the most efficient way possible.\n\n\nBlueMix Helps Build and Integrate Apps Quickly\n\n\n\n IBM’s new BlueMix services are designed to help businesses rapidly transform using Big Data, mobile and social technologies in the cloud. Some of the new BlueMix services include:   \n\n\n\n Cloud Integration services to securely connect and integrate an organization’s applications and information in the cloud. Developers can use pre-defined connectors for accelerated integration, or develop custom APIs as needed to easily and securely tie back into systems of record behind their firewall. Integrated API management capabilities provide an easy mechanism to publish self-service APIs, that can be shared with the broader API economy. This allows developers to mix cloud-based PaaS, third party cloud applications, and on-premises systems behind security gateways, moving between cloud and on-premises systems in a hybrid, integrated environment.    \n\n\n\n Internet of Things services allowing developers to register and connect networked devices such as microprocessors and embedded machine to machine sensors to the cloud, easily aggregating and reacting to data and events in real time. Organizations can build applications which efficiently manage, analyze, visualize, and interact with the massive quantities of temporal and spatial data generated by vehicles, wearables, mobile phones, cameras, computers, sensors and other intelligent devices. \n\n\n\n Big Data and Analytics services for developers to deliver data-centric mobile, web-scale applications. With these new services, including geospatial, time series, predictive scoring, and reporting, developers can easily create sophisticated applications that provide real-time actionable insight so that organizations can predict outcomes and make better business decisions. For example, a developer could create an application that integrates sensor data, location data, weather data and usage trends from a network of equipment to identify and avoid emerging maintenance issues. In addition, new data masking, discovery and audit capabilities help developers create applications with built-in data privacy and security. \n\n\n\n DevOps services enabling developers, IT departments and business teams with an open, integrated rapid development environment that scales from individual developers to enterprise teams. The DevOps Continuous Integration service will provide end-to-end “build” capabilities to speed changes through the development process, DevOps Mobile Quality Assurance (MQA) will help analyze user sentiment to spot problems before they go viral, and the Monitoring and Analytics service will identify application problems during development - leveraging analytics to help applications achieve availability and performance goals. In addition, DevOps will include a new RapidApp service that requires no coding, using visual tools to expand the scope of web and business applications developers can create. \n\n  \n\n\nIBM Bluemix is now in open beta\nWant to get started today? You can start today by joining the open beta. Want some help in creating a Bluemix application or service?

IBM will provide services and runtimes into the ecosystem based on our extensive software portfolio\nBluemix: Making a difference in the cloud\nWhen IBM envisioned Bluemix, we envisioned a system which would answer the needs and challenges facing developers while at the same time empowering and enabling businesses to leverage their resources in the most efficient way possible.   \nBlueMix Helps Build and Integrate Apps Quickly   IBM’s new BlueMix services are designed to help businesses rapidly transform using Big Data, mobile and social technologies in the cloud. Some of the new BlueMix services include: &nbsp;    Cloud Integration services to securely connect and integrate an organization’s applications and information in the cloud. Developers can use pre-defined connectors for accelerated integration, or develop custom APIs as needed to easily and securely tie back into systems of record behind their firewall. Integrated API management capabilities provide an easy mechanism to publish self-service APIs, that can be shared with the broader API economy. This allows developers to mix cloud-based PaaS, third party cloud applications, and on-premises systems behind security gateways, moving between cloud and on-premises systems in a hybrid, integrated environment.&nbsp; &nbsp;    Internet of Things services allowing developers to register and connect networked devices such as microprocessors and embedded machine to machine sensors to the cloud, easily aggregating and reacting to data and events in real time. Organizations can build applications which efficiently manage, analyze, visualize, and interact with the massive quantities of temporal and spatial data generated by vehicles, wearables, mobile phones, cameras, computers, sensors and other intelligent devices.    Big Data and Analytics services for developers to deliver data-centric mobile, web-scale applications. With these new services, including geospatial, time series, predictive scoring, and reporting, developers can easily create sophisticated applications that provide real-time actionable insight so that organizations can predict outcomes and make better business decisions. For example, a developer could create an application that integrates sensor data, location data, weather data and usage trends from a network of equipment to identify and avoid emerging maintenance issues. In addition, new data masking, discovery and audit capabilities help developers create applications with built-in data privacy and security.    DevOps services enabling developers, IT departments and business teams with an open, integrated rapid development environment that scales from individual developers to enterprise teams. The DevOps Continuous Integration service will provide end-to-end “build” capabilities to speed changes through the development process, DevOps Mobile Quality Assurance (MQA) will help analyze user sentiment to spot problems before they go viral, and the Monitoring and Analytics service will identify application problems during development - leveraging analytics to help applications achieve availability and performance goals. In addition, DevOps will include a new RapidApp service that requires no coding, using visual tools to expand the scope of web and business applications developers can create.  &nbsp;","created":"2014-04-22T10:04:50.000Z","city":"Pune","country":"IN","localized_country_name":"India","state":"","lat":18.530000686645508,"lon":73.83999633789062,"members":536,"timezone":"Asia/Calcutta","_id":14041882},{"name":"Next Gen Application Developers Nairobi","urlname":"Next-Gen-Application-Developers-Nairobi","description":"This is an IBM sponsored meetup group. \nGeared towards developers and technologists who want to create great apps.

Today’s needs require a database that is capable of providing a scalable, flexible solution to efficiently and safely manage the massive flow of data to and from a global user base.  \nDevelopers and IT alike are finding it difficult, and sometimes even impossible, to quickly incorporate all of this data into the relational model while dynamically scaling to maintain the performance levels users demand. This is causing many to look at NoSQL databases for the flexibility they offer, and is a big reason why the global NoSQL market is forecast to nearly double and reach $3.4 Billion in 2020*.&nbsp; \nTypes of NoSQL databases \nNoSQL is simply the term used to describe a family of databases that are all non-relational. While the technologies, data types, and use cases vary wildly&nbsp;among them, it is generally agreed that&nbsp;there are four types of NoSQL&nbsp;databases: Key-value stores, graph stores, column stores, document stores.\nWhy Consider NoSQL? \nThe various NoSQL databases available today differ quite a bit, but there are common threads uniting them: flexibility, scalability, availability, lower costs, and special capabilities.&nbsp;\n\nNoSQL MEETUP\nThis meetup consists of both presentations and hands-on exercises.&nbsp;\nOBJECTIVE&nbsp;\nWe talk about NoSQL databases in general and then differentiate each database from other data management platforms.
