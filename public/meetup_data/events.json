They encapsulate application logic in small, loosely-coupled, distributed services communicating via language-agnostic APIs. Despite their benefit, microservice-based solutions remain difficult to build using mainstream cloud technologies, often requiring control of a complex toolchain, and separate build and operations pipelines. At this meetup, we will share our experiences and practices that work for us and have been incorporated into our methodology. We'll show you our open toolchain platform that allows developers to define and standardize their DevOps toolchains, by selecting, integrating, configuring and organizing the best of open, third-party and IBM technologies to deliver innovative applications using a DevOps methodology.

So come to the Mad Scientists event at IBM Southbank for a rather special evening where IBM developers, members of the LJC and University researchers will be demonstrating a whole range of the latest software and tech. You’ll hear about personal projects, creations approach, the problems solved, the tech people have used. The flavour of the event will be more Tech Fair than conference or presentation, with a sharing of ideas and technologies.\n\nAmongst a wide range of talks and demonstrations we’ll be hearing from:\n\nDave Snowdon: Getting emotional about robots and clojure\n\nSocial robots have become a regular feature of tech news over the last couple of years. Whether it's talk about Dr Cynthia Breazeal's Jibo robot, Aldebaran's Pepper robot working as a shop assistant in Japan &amp; France or yet another robot platform being crowdfunded on indiegogo. But why should we care? Is a \"siri on wheels\" any better than a siri in the hand? Why would we want social robots to be emotional? This talk will skirt around some of these questions, deftly avoid mention of SkyNet and somehow show that clojure is the answer.\n\nBio: By day, a mild-mannered programmer working on Virtual Desktop Infrastructure at VMware. By night, when not asleep, plans world domination by social emotional robots powered by python and clojure. Before he was virtualised Dave worked for Xerox Research in France and, back in the mists of time, developed one of the first distributed multi-user virtual reality environments as part of his PhD work at Manchester.\n\nHolly Cummins (Talk title to be confirmed)\n\nWe are delighted to be able to include Holly Cummins in our speaker line up. Holly is well known to members of the LJC (her most recent talk to the community was Confessions of an Automation Addict) and she’s a leader in innovative technology. She is technical lead in IBM's Bluemix Garage London, and a committer on the Apache Aries project. She is a co-author of Enterprise OSGi in Action and has spoken at Devoxx, JavaZone, The ServerSide Java Symposium, JAX London, GeeCon, and the Great Indian Developer Summit, as well as a number of user groups.\n\nLaura Cowen : Ambient Kettle Project\n\nWhenever I boil my kettle to have a cup of tea in Hampshire my Mum, in Lancashire, gets a tweet. Sometimes Mum replies to that tweet to say that she's having a cup of tea too. It's the closest we can get to having a cup of tea together most of the time. It's this sense of 'ambient connectedness' that we tried to develop with the Ambient Kettle project. I'll talk through how it works and then how we tried to capture the essential aspects of boiling a kettle and making a cup of tea to create a physical representation of my kettle.\n\nBio: Laura is a developer advocate at IBM where she’s building the WASdev developer community around the Liberty Java application server. She previously worked in UX and technical writing during her 13 years at IBM. She gets involved in cool IoT projects for fun. Laura has a BSc in Psychology and a Masters in Human-Computer Interaction. She’s currently studying for a PhD in Psychology. She also presents on the Ubuntu Podcast on open source and technology, and has organised and volunteered at open source community conferences like OggCamp.\n\nAgenda:\n\nDoors open at 6:00 pm with talks and demonstrations until around 9:00 pm.\n\nVenue:\n\nBoyle, Darwin &amp; Fleming rooms, IBM Client Centre, 76/78 Upper Ground, South Bank, London SE1 9PZ\n\nhttp://www-05.ibm.com/uk/locations/sbnk.html\n\nDrinks and pizza will be available thanks to our sponsors, IBM.\n\nRSVP early to secure your place!","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/London-PaaS-Bluemix-Meetup/events/229340728/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"duration":10800000,"name":"Mad Scientists","time":1458842400000,"updated":1458853873000,"status":"past","group_id":14354522,"group_name":"London PaaS & Bluemix Meetup","lat":51.506952,"lon":-0.111438,"city":"London","country":"gb","_id":"229340728"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455807319000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"REGISTRATION WILL CLOSE MARCH 23RD FOR THIS EVENT.

This brings with it a new set of functional and technical challenges to overcome - how do these \"tiny apps\" communicate? How do they discover each other? How big is too big? In this talk, we will build a microservice-based architecture up from scratch, while discussing different design patterns and common pitfalls, all in Node.js.\n\nBio: Jonathan Kaufman is a Developer Advocate for IBM Emerging Technology currently residing in Cambridge, MA.

The processing of log mining aims to discover useful information, knowledge, and patterns from structures as well as unstructured logs. A log mining application is usually carried out in three main steps:\n\nPre-processing: The raw data is usually not suitable for mining due to various reasons. It may be messy, too large, and involve irrelevant attributes.Data mining: The processed data is then fed to a data mining algorithm which will produce patterns or knowledge.Post-processing: In many applications, not all discovered patterns are useful. This step identifies those useful ones for applications. Various evaluation and visualization techniques are used to make the decision.\n\nIn this webinar, we will go over each of these steps and analyze logs from a real-world application!Recommended for:\n\nData scientists and engineersDevelopers and technical team managersTechnical product managers\n\nWhat you'll learn:\n\nPre-processing tricks for working with messy log data.How to extract useful patterns and insights from unstructured logs.Make predictions about future events based on extracted patterns.\n\nWhat we’ll cover:\n\nUse time series analysis tools to munge log data.Extract useful patterns with frequent pattern mining algorithms.Learn rules and make predictions with association rule mining.\n\nIf the timing is not convenient, register to receive the recording of the session afterwards.","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Revealed-Austin/events/229048645/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":3600000,"name":"Webinar: Pattern Mining: Extracting Value from Log Data","time":1456254000000,"updated":1456259333000,"status":"past","group_id":14364582,"group_name":"Big Data Revealed","_id":"229048645"},{"utc_offset":0,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1450106324000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"MariaDB is a leading open source database solutions for SaaS, cloud and on-premises applications that require high availability, scalability and performance.

Consisting of Docker Engine, a portable, lightweight run-time and packaging tool, and Docker Hub, a cloud service for sharing applications and automating work-flows, Docker enables apps to be quickly assembled from components and eliminates the friction between development, QA, and production environments. As a result, IT can ship faster and run the same app, unchanged, on laptops, data center VMs, and any cloud.

Before joining IBM, he worked at a data mining company in DC, where he wrote software to analyze political systems around the world. Josh is very interested in Artificial Intelligence and how it can/will improve the interaction between human and computers.\n\nCognitive IoT: Making the Internet of Things Deliver for All of Us\n\nThe early visionaries of the Internet of Things, IBM’s thought leaders among them, foresaw a time when practically any physical object could be equipped with sensors and hooked up to the Internet to translate the physical world into digital information.They were focusing on factory assembly lines, electrical grids, automobiles, highways, buildings, and the like. The goal was to gather streams of information from sensors that could be used to automate processes such as balancing supply and demand in a power grid and operate more efficiently.Today, these applications have become mainstream, so it’s time to take advantage of a second generation of Internet of Things technologies and capabilities something we at IBM call the Cognitive Internet of Things.Cognitive IoT technologies will make it possible for business leaders to understand what’s happening in the world more deeply. By infusing intelligence into systems and processes, businesses will be able to not only do things more efficiently, but to improve customer satisfaction, to discover new business opportunities, and to anticipate risks and threats so they can better deal with them.As powerful as today’s sensor networks are, they aren’t up to the task of unlocking the complex interrelationships between people, places and things that drive business and the economy. To reach the next level, businesses need cognitive technologies that enable them to gather and integrate data from many types of sensors and other sources, to reason over that data, and to learn from their interactions with it.\n\n#IBMWatson","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/IBM-Watson-and-Cognitive-Computing/events/227441913/","yes_rsvp_count":257,"duration":7200000,"name":"IBM Watson + Robots = Cognitive IoT ","time":1453777200000,"updated":1453829448000,"status":"past","group_id":12742492,"group_name":"IBM Watson and Cognitive Computing","_id":"227441913"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452193113000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Please join EMC for the grand opening of the first EMC-Pivotal Cloud Foundry dojo in the heart of the Cambridge tech hub.\n\nWHAT:\n\nThis EMC-hosted cocktail party is an opportunity to meet the Cloud Foundry Community and to celebrate the opening of the joint EMC-Pivotal Cloud Foundry Dojo.\n\nWHEN:\n\nFri., Jan. 22 from 2:00 – 4:00 pm\n\nWHERE:\n\nEMC offices – 11 Cambridge Center (145 Broadway), Cambridge, MA\n\nWHO:\n\nPlease join the Cloud Foundry Foundation CEO Sam Ramji, Cloud Foundry Chairman of the Board John Roese, EMC President Brian Gallagher, Cloud Foundry developers, partners, customers, press and analysts\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nIt can typically take upwards of a year for a developer to gain committer status on an open source project. In some cases, even longer. The Cloud Foundry Foundation offers a unique approach to gaining committer in as little as six weeks, which we call the Cloud Foundry Dojo. The program is derived from the Pivotal labs Dojo program. It allows developers to master Cloud Foundry by working shoulder to shoulder on the open-source project with other Cloud Foundry engineers. Qualified engineers from the Cloud Foundry community can participate in pair programming with committers on a Cloud Foundry project team, gain invaluable experience with the core technology and the unique agile development environment, and make direct contributions to the codebase. Participation typically lasts 6-12 weeks.\n\n· Become part of the EMC Cloud Foundry Technical Community\n\n· Learn DevOps practices and culture\n\n· Accelerate your knowledge of the Cloud Foundry platform\n\n· Develop relationships with all the key contributors\n\n· Lead the next wave of innovation\n\nEMC's Cambridge-based Dojo will host software developers from EMC customers and partners, along with developers from EMC's own software engineering ranks.

In his current role he is responsible for overseeing WANdisco's product strategy. In his previous role as a founder and chief technology officer (CTO) of Librados, an application integration software provider, Jim was responsible for overall product strategy and product messaging. He was also a member of the management team that led the company’s acquisition by NetManage, Inc. Following its acquisition, Jim joined NetManage as CTO for the Librados products group.\n\nPrior to Librados, he was the vice president of product management for Insevo, a middleware company specializing in enterprise application integration. Jim also held senior product management, product marketing and consulting management positions at BEA Systems and SAP AG.\n\n• Big SQL - Making all of your big data SQL accessible using an optimal execution strategy. Presenter: Benjamin Lumbert, Big Data Systems Engineer, IBM\n\nContinuous Data Management for Hadoop and Spark – On-Premise or in the Cloud\n\nBig Data makes it possible to inexpensively store and process petabytes of structured, unstructured and semi-structured data generated at incredible speeds. However, the ultimate benefits of big data are lost if fresh, fast-moving data is not analyzed as it happens. Fast data is about data in motion—immediate response and action.\n\nThe collection process for data in motion is essentially the same as data at rest, but the key difference is the analysis occurs in real time as data is generated and captured. However, this analysis has to include the historical context provided by data at rest in order to be meaningful. This requires an enterprise-ready architecture that efficiently handles both data at rest and data in motion with the following components:\n\n- An enterprise grade Big Data platform to support real-time analytics applications without downtime or data loss- A flexible and agile cloud environment for cost-effective burst-out processing- A data migration/replication engine that exceeds the most demanding application SLAs.\n\nThis meet up will provide an overview of the “best in class” architecture required to harness the benefits of Big Data with “Continuous Data Management for Hadoop and Spark”\n\nBigSQL 4.1.  Presenter: Benjamin Lumbert, Big Data Systems Engineer, IBM\n\nBig SQL provides ANSI SQL access to data across any system from Hadoop, via JDBC or ODBC - seamlessly whether that data exists in Hadoop or a relational data base. This means that developers familiar with the SQL programming language can access data in Hadoop without having to learn new languages or skills. Big SQL sets a new bar: performance. Benchmark tests indicate that Big SQL executes queries 20 times faster, on average, over Apache Hive 12 with performance improvements ranging up to 70 times faster. It can query and combine data from many data sources, including (but not limited to) DB2 for Linux, Teradata, Oracle, UNIX and Windows database software, IBM PureData System for Analytics.\n\nWith Big SQL, all of your big data is SQL accessible. It presents a structured view of your existing data, using an optimal execution strategy, given your available resources.\n\nParking\n\n- On-site valet $8 per car","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Chicago/events/226883184/","yes_rsvp_count":70,"duration":10800000,"name":"Continuous Data Management for Hadoop and Spark – On-Premise or in the Cloud","time":1452727800000,"updated":1452739866000,"status":"past","group_id":6285502,"group_name":"Big Data Developers in Chicago","lat":41.886959,"lon":-87.65181,"city":"Chicago","state":"IL","country":"us","_id":"226883184"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452119860000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":3},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Your invited to a free Lunch &amp; Learn.\n\nNOTE: Space is limited.

As part of this work, we have developed open-source tools in a variety of languages. One of this tools, Innkeeper, is a simple, RESTful route management API built on top of reactive technologies like Akka HTTP and Slick. It will help our fleet of router instances to keep their routes in sync.\n\nIn this presentation, I'll discuss Innkeeper’s architecture and how — by choosing a reactive stack of technologies — we can stream database records back to the browser. I’ll talk about how (and why) we secured our API using OAuth, and give insights on how we use Docker and the STUPS tools to auto-scale this API on top of AWS. Finally, I’ll describe how we designed a set of unit and integration tests to make sure that our application works correctly, and how we set up our continuous integration environment.\n\nAbout the speaker: Dan Persa has been a software engineer at Zalando since 2013 and is a member of the Fashion Store team, which is responsible for Zalando’s core ecommerce business. He loves Java and Scala and more recently has been exploring Go and Node.js. He’s a big fan of clean code and software craftsmanship. In addition to coding, he enjoys mentoring new developers, organizing coder dojos and reading groups and giving tech talks. In his free time he likes to take photos and dance salsa.\n\nDiscussion 2\n\nTitle: Cloud Scale Machine Learning with ApacheSpark, MLLIB, Cloudfoundry and OpenStack Swift\n\nSpeaker: Romeo Kienzler - Chief Data Scientist - IBM Cloud Transformation Lab Zurich\n\nAbstract: Clouds provide very cost effective access to computing power and storage.

Every developer wants their local environment to feel complete. But if you are building cloud-native application, wouldn’t it be great to deploy your code onto your laptop, as if it was your dev cloud? In this talk Sujay Maheshwari (Developer Evangelist, HPE Helion) introduces HPE Helion Stackato, where developers get an easy way to get started with exploring the power of Cloud Foundry. After HPE Helion Stackato setup, this talk will also show how to deploy a sample app via Docker. This talk is zero slide, all code. Bring your laptop if you want to follow through and transform your laptop to become a cloud. by\n\nSpeaker Bios:\n\n• Sujay Maheshwari is a developer evangelist at HPE Helion. In the past, he has built his own companies in mobile ad-tech and content marketing space. Prior to that, Sujay was a Product Manager at Morgan Stanley.

To register you need to join (for Free) SkillsMatter here, please also RSVP here so we know how many of our group will be going.\n\nAre you interested in getting to grips with machine learning, and how it can be used to create an Internet of Things system with IBM SystemML and Apache Spark?\n\nNikolay Manchev (Big Data Technical Specialist, IBM Analytics) will cover IBM's commitment to Spark, how IBM SystemML can help advance machine learning, how to roll out machine learning algorithms in production and how to achieve shorter development times and increased algorithm performance\n\nJan Machacek (Cake Solutions) will explore the latest developments of the MUVR project. After a brief introduction on the nature of distributed systems (from distributed databases, through distributed state, to distributed computation), you will learn how to use Akka Cluster and Akka Persistence to implement such distributed systems. Once the data is safely stored in a journal, it is important to be able to perform deeper analysis. To do so, Jan will show you how to access the data in the journal in a distributed computation program running in Apache Spark.\n\nWith the mechanics done, Jan will explain how to use (deep) neural networks that can be very easily trained to recognize patterns in the ingested data.\n\nYou will learn the advantages and traps of designing distributed domains, data and computation: systems that may become the next generation of financial systems, bringing elasticity, resilience and responsiveness. You will look in particular at systems that consume data from IoT / wearables, and that perform immediate and batch analyses.\n\nRegistration from 6pm, talks begin at 6:30pm. As always this is followed with the opportunity to network with the speakers and your peers.","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-London/events/227186710/","yes_rsvp_count":190,"name":"Machine Learning, Deep Learning, SystemML & Apache Spark","time":1450290600000,"updated":1450345894000,"status":"past","group_id":9516272,"group_name":"Big Data Developers in London","_id":"227186710"},{"utc_offset":3600000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1450111141000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"This is an open office hour for Bluemix.

Please join us and our awesome presenters on Dec 9th at 5:30 pm . See you there!\n\nAGENDA\n\n• Continuous Data Management for Hadoop and Spark – On-Premise or in the Cloud. Brett Rudenstein, Director of Product Management, Big Data, Wandisco\n\n• Deploying Big Data in the Insurance Industry. David Skrivanek – Big Data expert from a leading insurance company\n\n• Big SQL - Making all of your big data SQL accessible using an optimal execution strategy. Presenters: Michael Harkins, Virender Thakur, IBM\n\nContinuous Data Management for Hadoop and Spark – On-Premise or in the Cloud\n\nKEYNOTE SPEAKER:\n\nBrett Rudenstein, Director of Product Management, Big Data, Wandisco\n\nBrett Rudenstein has an extensive background in Application Lifecycle Management, High Performance Computing and Open Source Software Analysis. He has held senior sales engineering and management positions at Rational Software, PureAtria, IBM, Appistry and Palamida. Throughout his career, he has enabled organizations to accelerate technology adoption by understanding their needs and providing just-in-time business solutions. As WANdisco Director of Product Management for Big Data, Brett works with partners, prospects, and customers to help them understand and evolve the requirements for enterprise-ready Hadoop.\n\n----------------\n\nBig Data makes it possible to inexpensively store and process petabytes of structured, unstructured and semi-structured data generated at incredible speeds. However, the ultimate benefits of big data are lost if fresh, fast-moving data is not analyzed as it happens. Fast data is about data in motion—immediate response and action.\n\nThe collection process for data in motion is essentially the same as data at rest, but the key difference is the analysis occurs in real time as data is generated and captured. However, this analysis has to include the historical context provided by data at rest in order to be meaningful. This requires an enterprise-ready architecture that efficiently handles both data at rest and data in motion with the following components:\n\n- An enterprise grade Big Data platform to support real-time analytics applications without downtime or data loss - A flexible and agile cloud environment for cost-effective burst-out processing - A data migration/replication engine that exceeds the most demanding application SLAs.\n\nThis meet up will provide an overview of the “best in class” architecture required to harness the benefits of Big Data with “Continuous Data Management for Hadoop and Spark”\n\nBig SQL 4.1. Presenters:\n\nMichael Harkins, Virender Thakur, IBM\n\nBig SQL provides ANSI SQL access to data across any system from Hadoop, via JDBC or ODBC - seamlessly whether that data exists in Hadoop or a relational data base. This means that developers familiar with the SQL programming language can access data in Hadoop without having to learn new languages or skills. Big SQL sets a new bar: performance. Benchmark tests indicate that Big SQL executes queries 20 times faster, on average, over Apache Hive 12 with performance improvements ranging up to 70 times faster. It can query and combine data from many data sources, including (but not limited to) DB2 for Linux, Teradata, Oracle, UNIX and Windows database software, IBM PureData System for Analytics.\n\nWith Big SQL, all of your big data is SQL accessible. It presents a structured view of your existing data, using an optimal execution strategy, given your available resources.\n\nPARKING\n\nStreet parking in certain areas (across the street &amp; up to 2 blocks away) at 5pm is free. Check the signs so as not to get booted!\n\nGarage parking is on Columbus Drive in the same building as HopsScotch. They validate parking for $2.00 up to 4 hours.","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-NYC/events/226995075/","yes_rsvp_count":63,"duration":10800000,"name":"Continuous Data Management for Hadoop and Spark – On-Premise or in the Cloud","time":1449700200000,"updated":1457722209000,"status":"past","group_id":5347552,"group_name":"Big Data Developers in NYC","lat":40.717823,"lon":-74.036308,"city":"Jersey City","state":"NJ","country":"us","_id":"226995075"},{"utc_offset":0,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445263245000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"With the latest release of the OpenPOWER servers, built by Tyan and Wistron.

The buzzword behind this is DOCKER. Although present for many years in cgroups, namespaces and LXC - container based virtualzation really took off as Docker Inc. brought this technology to the masses. Today, every 2nd IT startup is running on DOCKER. Enterprises and Academic institutions are slowly adapting as well.

The buzzword behind this is DOCKER. Although present for many years in cgroups, namespaces and LXC - container based virtualzation really took off as Docker Inc. brought this technology to the masses. Today, every 2nd IT startup is running on DOCKER. Enterprises and Academic institutions are slowly adapting as well. In this session we will learn what DOCKER really is, what Linux Kernel extensions are used and how you can use it in your environment.

The microservices architecture, which is the basis of many new age distributed systems such as OpenStack, NetFlix and so on, is at the heart of Cloud Foundry - a complete developer-oriented Platform as a Service (PaaS) that is IaaS agnostic and supports vCloud, OpenStack and AWS.\n\nWe will discuss the microservices architecture, 12-factor app, containers, etc., and how to architect applications for the cloud in general and Cloud Foundry in particular. Attend this demo-oriented session in which we will cover the basics of Cloud Foundry. He will also cover many of the Non Functional Requirements (NFR), which is typically in the domain of the architect such as scaling, security and HA and how applications can leverage Bluemix for these.\n\nAfter attending this session, attendees will walk away with a better understanding of Platform as a Service and Cloud Foundry in general, and Bluemix in particular and how the ecosystem enables deploying applications to the cloud a lot easier. Attendees will also be able to understand how to enable logging, remote debugging, monitoring and so on by turning a few knobs in the platform.\n\nRaghavan Srinivas\n\nRaghavan \"Rags\" Srinivas (@ragss) works as an Architect/Developer Evangelist at IBM with a mission to help developers build highly scalable and available systems.

SAMEntics thus provides an intelligent alternative to handling large volumes of text efficiently by not only automatically creating clusters based off user intent in a hierarchical manner but also generating rewordings of user queries in the case of sparse and(or) poor quality partner data.PhrazIt on the other hand provides an essence extraction tool that helps establish thematic relevance to text and is aimed at rendering the most thematically relevant sentences from the partner TREC files . PhrazIt thus renders the most relevant sentences from passages of text and if plugged into JumpQA (a question generation tool) could also be utilized for enhancing partner ground truth.Requirements for the talk :Some familiarity with machine learning algorithmic paradigms, basic understanding of tasks in natural language processing, some awareness of concepts like distributed semantic space, ensemble classifiers and graph based ranking.Bonus section :\"What's hot in data science\". Join us as we go over the current and emerging state of the art. Dive deep in what is changing the world.

If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.\n\nSpark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more.\n\nDo you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does. Emphatically. That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.\n\nOn June 15, 2015, IBM hosted a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design.

Flink is one of the most active big data projects in the Apache Software Foundation and has more than 100 contributors. The core of Flink is a distributed stream processing engine that enables low-latency and high throughput data processing. Flink has high-level APIs for both stream and batch processing.In the first part of this talk we will briefly look at the history of Flink and then present the APIs and different use cases. Here we will also see how it can be deployed in practice.In the second part, we will look at the streaming execution engine that powers Flink. Here we will see what makes it tick and also what distinguishes it from other approaches, such as the mini-batch execution model. We will cover Flink's architecture and design decisions that result in Flink's unique set of features.\n\nFeeding a Squirrel in Time -- Windows in Apache Flink\n\nIn data stream processing, the dimension of time is a crucial aspect with regard to runtime effects as well as query semantics. There are two different time concepts: event-time also called occurrence time, ie, the time in which an event happens in the real world, and processing-time, ie, the time in which an events gets processed by the system. Both time dimensions deliver different semantics if used to specify windows on a data stream.In this talk, we give an introduction to time-base data streamprocessing and cover Flink's approach to handle windowing. Flink offers a broad range of (non-/)deterministic count-, time-, and custom-windows while offering a simple API to express those.\n\nPlease note that this event has also been posted here: http://www.meetup.com/inovex-munich/events/226206381/\n\nWe would like to thank our host Inovex GmbH for providing the location, food and drinks.","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Munich/events/226576873/","yes_rsvp_count":40,"name":"Stream & Batch Processing with Apache Flink and Event-Time Windowing","time":1447263000000,"updated":1447278875000,"status":"past","group_id":14476282,"group_name":"Big Data Developers in Munich","lat":48.13539,"lon":11.663948,"city":"München","country":"de","_id":"226576873"},{"utc_offset":3600000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1442567190000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Agenda:\n\n5 PM Reception, Drings, some Food\n\n5:30 PM Introduction to DOCKER\n\n6 PM How to leverage cloud and analytics to capture real-time customer emotional insights\n\n6:30 PM Introduction to Apache Spark ----\n\nIntroduction to DOCKER\n\nContainer based virtualization is the new hype coming from Silicon Valley 2015. The buzzword behind this is DOCKER. Although present for many years in cgroups, namespaces and LXC - container based virtualzation really took off as Docker Inc. brought this technology to the masses. Today, every 2nd IT startup is running on DOCKER. Enterprises and Academic institutions are slowly adapting as well. In this session we will learn what DOCKER really is, what Linux Kernel extensions are used and how you can use it in your environment. We will create a DOCKER image from scratch, add persistent storage to it and showcase a little cluster computing task using ApacheFlink and DOCKER-Compose. Finally I'll give you a short introduction to DOCKER on the cloud - currently offered by nearly every cloud service provider - and exemplified in the IBM Bluemix Platform Cloud.How to leverage cloud and analytics to capture real-time customer emotional insights\n\nTim Llewellynn, CEO and Cofounder\n\nnViso is a leading provider of emotion recognition software that interprets human facial micro-expressions and eye movements captured through video. Its solutions use 3D facial imaging technology with artificial intelligence to track hundreds of different facial points to recognize human emotions. The company combines the latest advancements in computer science, engineering and behavioral sciences to make automatic emotion recognition a viable reality using any image based device. Tim Llewellynn will present how his company uses IBM Watson Foundations, Softlayer and Analytics software to analyze digital emotional reactions from customers via the cloud and hence enable businesses to make better informed decisions and create more engaging and interactive experiences.\n\nIntroduction to Apache Spark\n\nHave you ever wondered how to develop a service and deploy it into the cloud? In this tutorial come join us and learn how to develop a service and integrate with other services on Bluemix, IBM’s award winning hybrid cloud development platform. IBM Analytics for Apache Spark is now opening up new avenues to develop next-generation analytics that combine the power of Spark with the rich set of data-centric Services available on Bluemix in new and innovative ways. The contents of this tutorial includes a deep dive and detailed code walk through of a sample application that does sentiment analysis on twitter conversations by integrating Spark streaming and Spark Twitter API with Watson Tone Analyzer Service. In this presentation, you’ll learn how to set up a local development environment for Scala using the SBT tool, how to package, deploy and run your Spark Streaming application on a Jupyter Scala Notebook on Bluemix and finally how to create compelling analytics and visualization’s using a IPython Notebook.\n\nWe’ll complete the tutorial with a discussion on the main Spark use cases and the architectural patterns to implement them.","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/HackSessionsSwitzerland/events/225441845/","yes_rsvp_count":25,"duration":10800000,"name":"Introduction to Docker, Streamcomputing on ApacheSpark and InfoSphere Streams","time":1447257600000,"updated":1447269881000,"status":"past","group_id":14151612,"group_name":"HackSessionsSwitzerland","lat":46.517075,"lon":6.562284,"city":"Lausanne","country":"ch","_id":"225441845"},{"utc_offset":-28800000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446911726000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Get ready to rock your data at a meetup on Tuesday, November 10th.

Examples would be something that measures (or even predicts) macro indicators like inflation, gdp, unemployment and manufacturing.\n\n2) Parse sentiment in financial news/social media text and/or video and image content on the web using Bluemix to create a sentiment based indicator that can measure and/or predict market direction.\n\n3) Analyze huge volumes of sec.gov data to perform real time fundamental analysis on companies using public filings using Watson. Insight should be useful in identifying undervalued stocks or short sale candidates. An offshoot project may involve scanning regulatory filings in real time and cross referencing options markets to create an indicator that could flag potential insider trading activity.\n\n4) Use Bluemix to create a polling tool that can be used to gather consensus opinion from alpha modus users about various topics like stock market direction, a stock's price or even a political election, a sporting event or new product release. Apply creativity in determining topics to poll. Then create an interactive real time visualization to display results of the poll.\n\nSuggested Bluemix APIs to Use:Alchemy APIConcept Expansion and InsightLanguage TranslationPersonality InsightsTrade Off AnalysisDataWorksInsights for TwitterPredictive AnalyticsStream AnalyticsData CacheSession cacheGeoCoding\n\nWrite your app in Node.js, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, Go or bring your own runtime.

Découvrez les dernières tendances!\n\nJames Watters est VP et general manager Pivotal Cloud Platform en charge de la R&amp;D et du développement des produits et communautés Cloud Foundry, Spring, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, RabbitMQ et Redis.\n\n• Cloud Foundry pour les containers avec HP Helion Development Platform (en anglais)\n\nContainers, containers, containers. Everyone loves containers. HP Helion and Cloud Foundry provide more than just your standard container management platform. CF provides full application management, service management and is driven by leveraging the power of containers. For developers, containers can be created and managed automatically, or you can bring your own. Join us to learn how the Helion Development Platform uses containers and sandboxing (for native Windows support) to power the next wave of enterprise application innovation.\n\nAlvaro Peon-Sanchez is the Product Manager for the Cloud Foundry components in HP Helion Developer Platform. Alvaro has extensive experience developing software platforms and services. Alvaro is a computer systems engineer with an MBA from UC Berkeley. Alvaro loves to learn about software technologies and leverage it to unlock value to customers.\n\n• Pivotal Cloud Foundry pour DevOps : les rôles de Platform Ops et Application Ops (en Français)\n\nTout le monde s'accorde sur le fait que \"DevOps\" vise à réduire les points de friction entre le Dev et les Ops. Cloud Foundry propose une séparation des responsabilités \"opérations\" entre les \"opérateurs plateforme\" et les \"opérateurs d'applications\".Les Platform Ops sont responsables de maintenir la plateforme, sa sécurité, sa capacité et ses fonctionnalités transverses pour les développeurs et le maintien en condition opérationnelles. Les Application Ops sont garants de la disponibilité et de la performance des applications tout en étant très proches des projets, des développements et des livraisons - que ce soit sous la forme d'applications Spring, PHP, ... ou de containers tels que Docker dans Cloud Foundry. Les deux rôles sont des éléments clés dans l'agilité et la mise en place de DevOps à l'échelle de l'entreprise.\n\nMerci à Ippon qui sponsorise cette soirée ( http://www.ippon.fr/ )","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/CloudFoundry-France/events/225931070/","yes_rsvp_count":31,"name":"Cloud Foundry Summit + CF avec les containers (HP) + CF pour DevOps (Pivotal)","time":1446742800000,"updated":1447173476000,"status":"past","group_id":17920332,"group_name":"Cloud Foundry France","lat":48.875084,"lon":2.288394,"city":"Paris, 75016","country":"fr","_id":"225931070"},{"utc_offset":-28800000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1430860214000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"IBM Cloud Office Hours: Have questions about building apps in the Cloud?

Much of this dialogue has been measured and insightful, advancing our collective understanding and providing a peek into the future; at other times, it has been misleading and alarmist, even potentially detrimental to progress.\n\nBeyond the hype, we will explore meaningful applications of these emerging technologies at the Third Annual IBM Research Cognitive Colloquium: Augmenting Human Intelligence, and want you to be part of the conversation. I am pleased to invite you to join a world-class group of peers comprising the field's foremost academics, researchers, influencers and business leaders at this milestone event on October 13, 2015, at the Mission Bay Conference Center in San Francisco, California.\n\nTogether, we will look at a fascinating and diverse set of issues related to the powerful cognitive technologies that are emerging to augment human capacity and understanding. We'll be led by some of the world's top scientific thinkers, who will share provocative insights into the deep scientific and technical work underway to create an entirely new model for how people and intelligent systems will work together to enhance human cognition and expertise.\n\nSpeakers include Professor Terrence Sejnowski, a pioneer in computational neuroscience; Professor Yoshua Bengio, an internationally recognized leader in machine learning; and Professor Jaime Carbonell, a renowned expert in machine translation and natural language processing.\n\nI hope that you can join us for what promises to be an exceptional event.

He is also a co-founder of Databricks. Before Databricks, he was pursuing a Ph.D. in the University of California-Berkeley AMPLab.\n\nTitle: State of Spark, and where it is going.\n\nAbstract:In his extended version of his keynote talk, Reynold will look back and review Spark’s growth in adoption, use cases, and development. He will then look forward and discuss both technical initiatives and the evolution of the Spark community for 2016.\n\n2015 is the year of data science and platformization for Apache Spark. With new high-level APIs (e.g. DataFrames, machine learning pipelines, R) and extension points, Spark is accessible to a wider set of users and can plug in a myriad of data sources, algorithms, and external packages. 2015 also marks the beginning of Project Tungsten, a major revamp of Spark’s execution engine to improve its robustness and performance. In 2016, we will continue pushing the boundaries of these dimensions, making Spark even easier and more powerful.\n\n=============\n\nSpeaker: Chris Fregly is a Principal Data Solutions Engineer for the newly-formed IBM Spark Technology Center, an Apache Spark Contributor, a Netflix Open Source Committer, as well as the Organizer of the global Advanced Apache Spark Meetup and Author of the Upcoming Book, Advanced Spark.

He is one of the top committers in the open source community of Tachyon project. Prior to Tachyon Nexus, he worked in Google to build the next-generation storage infrastructure and won Google's Technical Infrastructure award. Bin had publication in most prestigious acadmic conferences in Computer Science including SIGCOMM, SOSP, NSDI, and got his PhD in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University\nTitle: Introduction to Memory-centric Distributed Storage System Tachyon and Its Use Case\nAbstract:Memory is the key to fast Big Data processing. This has been realized by many, and frameworks such as Spark and Shark already leverage memory performance. As data sets continue to grow, storage is increasingly becoming a critical bottleneck in many workloads.\nTo address this need, we have developed Tachyon, a memory centric fault-tolerant distributed file system, which enables reliable file sharing at memory-speed across cluster frameworks, such as Spark and MapReduce. Tachyon caches working set files in memory, and enables different jobs/queries and frameworks to access cached files at memory speed. Different from traditional replication scheme, Tachyon achieves fault-tolerance by leveraging lineage information.\nOver two years of research and production deployment, Tachyon as an open-source system has more than 160 contributors from over 50 institutions, including IBM, Yahoo, Intel, Redhat, Baidu, and Tachyon Nexus. We had a major release, version 0.8 in October 2015, including numerous new features. In particular, the latest version support mounting of multiple under storage systems and transparent naming enables more exciting use cases for Tachyon users, remote write to allow users to write to Tachyon through remote workers, detailed monitoring of the master and workers, and integration with Yarn and Mesos. In the presentation, we will also explore several potential industry use cases enabled by the new features.\n=============\nSpeaker: Kostas Sakellis is a Software Engineer and contributor to Apache Spark. Previous to that, he contributed to the extensibility effort on Cloudera Manager. Before Cloudera, Kostas did a 6 year stint at Amazon working across various teams including platform infrastructure. Kostas has a Bachelors of Mathematics in Computer Science from the University of Waterloo.\nTitle: Apache Spark 101: Taming Big Data\nAbstract:Apache Spark has become a very popular data processing framework due to its speed and easy of use. In this talk we will start at the beginning and give a brief technical introduction to key Spark concepts and differentiators. We will dive deep into the core architecture of Spark and discuss improvements over MapReduce. We will conclude with a few examples of Spark being used to solve real world problems.\n=============","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Singapore/events/226995364/","yes_rsvp_count":71,"name":"December Meetup during Strata!","time":1448965800000,"updated":1448984089000,"status":"past","group_id":12764782,"group_name":"Big Data Developers in Singapore","lat":1.352083,"lon":103.819839,"city":"Suntec City","country":"sg","_id":"226995364"},{"utc_offset":28800000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444296044000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"With zero cost, you can get the highest performance Cloud with IBM SoftLayer &amp; IBM Bluemix!
