Doors open at 5:30pm for registration and networking, while the program starts at 6:30pm.\n\nWith smart phones and fully instrumented cars, the amount of data we can collect from moving objects is growing at staggering rates. In a few years, the automotive industry will be the largest data producer of data after utilities -- bigger than health care. And with this Big Data volume comes Big Data challenges. The opportunity for applying all this data in real-time to problems in transportation, congestion management, emergency response, microweather prediction, supply chain management, and so on is tremendous. But this requires a real-time analytics platform that can integrate GPS locations, telematics messages and sensor readings, video, and other kinds of information--and scale up to any level.\n\nJoin us to learn about how IBM InfoSphere Streams is addressing this Big Data challenge. The event will kick off with a presentation and will be followed by a live demo. Bring your laptop, because you'll then have an opportunity to get hands on with InfoSphere Streams and apply this exciting new technology yourself!\n\nPizza &amp; beverages will be provided!\n\nAgenda\n\n5:30pm: Registration &amp; Networking &amp; Pizza!\n\n6:30pm: Presentation\n\n7:15pm: Break\n\n7:30pm: Demo\n\n8:15pm: Hands On with Real-time Analytics\n\nUse this link: http://bigdatauniversity.com/courses/course/view.php?id=513Enrollment key: meet123up\n\nYou will need VMware Player or VMware Fusion to run the VMware image.\n\n** Seating is limited, please only RSVP 'Yes' if you do plan to attend **","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/BigDataDevelopers/events/115851672/","yes_rsvp_count":55,"duration":12600000,"name":"Big Data Meetup: Real-time Location Based Analytics","time":1367541000000,"updated":1367971400000,"status":"past","group_id":4013112,"group_name":"Big Data Developers","_id":"115851672"},{"utc_offset":-25200000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1368766857000,"rating":{"count":4,"average":4.75},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Participate in an exclusive Big Data Developer Day hosted by the IBM Big Data Technical Sales team.

Apache HBase is known as the Hadoop Database and is included in IBM's InfoSphere BigInsights product. HBase is typically deployed on clusters of Linux x86 servers running on top of Apache Hadoop's HDFS. HBase clusters scale seamlessly as new nodes are added to the system. Cost is dramatically reduced,and the big data challenges often found in Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMs) are solved with HBase (e.g. sharding is automatic and sparse data records supported). Whereas existing RDBMSs can manage terabytes of data and support thousands of queries per second, HBase can easily support petabytes of data and millions of queries per second!\n\nIf you're considering HBase for your data storage needs, learning about the HBase data model and architecture is critical. This Meetup will give you hands-on HBase experience. You will go through the basics of how to install HBase, create schemas and tables, query your data, backup your tables, manage, monitor and tune HBase. You’ll also learn about the various client options including Big SQL and Hive.\n\nThis Meetup is FREE. Food and beverages will be provided.

Sometimes there is simply too much data to collect and store before analyzing it. Sometimes it’s an issue of timing – by the time they store data on disk, analyze it, and respond – it’s too late. Organizations need a way to harness the natural resource of streaming data and turn it into actionable insight. Enter stream computing.\n\nStream computing changes where, when and how much of your business data you can analyze. By extracting insight from data as it is streaming, you can react to events as they are happening to reshape business outcomes. Store less, analyze more, and make better decisions, faster.

This Meetup will be a presentation, demo and hands-on lab.\n\nAs enterprises seek to gain operational efficiencies and competitive advantage through greater use of analytics, much of the new information they need to analyze is found in text documents and, increasingly, in a wide variety of social media sites and portals. A critical step in gaining insights from this information is extracting core data from huge volumes of text. That data is then available for downstream analytic, mining and machine learning tools.

Doors open at 6pm for registration and networking, while the program starts at 6:30pm. This Meetup is FREE. Food &amp; beverages will be provided.\n\nWith smart phones and fully instrumented cars, the amount of data we can collect from moving objects is growing at staggering rates. In a few years, the automotive industry will be the largest data producer of data after utilities -- bigger than health care. And with this Big Data volume comes Big Data challenges. The opportunity for applying all this data in real-time to problems in transportation, congestion management, emergency response, microweather prediction, supply chain management, and so on is tremendous. But this requires a real-time analytics platform that can integrate GPS locations, telematics messages and sensor readings, video, and other kinds of information--and scale up to any level. Beyond automotive applications, the need for a real-time big-data analytics platform is becoming critical in other industries, including Government, Telecommunications, Healthcare, Energy and Utilities, Finance, and Manufacturing.\n\nBring your laptop, because you'll have an opportunity to get hands-on with InfoSphere Streams and apply this exciting new technology yourself! If you're not ready to get your hands dirty, that's OK. We'll also be showing an additional deep dive demo of how to build a real-time analytics application.\n\nAgenda\n\n6pm: Registration &amp; Networking (Food and beverages provided)\n\n** Giveaway for the first 25 attendees **\n\n6:30pm: Introduction to Real-Time Analytics and Stream Computing\n\n7:15pm: Live Demo of a Real-time Analytics Use Case\n\n7:30pm: Creating a Real-time Analytics Application\n\nRoom 1 - Hands-on -- Bring your laptops\n\nRoom 2 - Deep-dive demo -- Sit back and watch the experts show you step by step.\n\nIf you plan to get hands-on, here are additional details:\n\nBring your own laptop.

This Meetup will be a presentation, demo and hands-on lab.\n\nAs enterprises seek to gain operational efficiencies and competitive advantage through greater use of analytics, much of the new information they need to analyze is found in text documents and, increasingly, in a wide variety of social media sites and portals. A critical step in gaining insights from this information is extracting core data from huge volumes of text. That data is then available for downstream analytic, mining and machine learning tools. AQL (Annotator Query Language) is a powerful declarative, rule-based language for the extraction of information from text documents.\n\nThis Meetup is FREE. Food and beverages will be provided.

Spread evenly over a year, that amounts to approximately 13 minutes every day. As a consumer, the thought of online bank operations being inaccessible so frequently is disturbing. As a business owner, when systems go down, all processes come to a stop. Work in progress is destroyed and failure to meet SLA’s and contractual obligations can result in expensive fees, adverse publicity, and loss of current and potential future customers. Ultimately the inability to provide a reliable and stable system results in loss of $$$’s. While the failure of these systems is inevitable, the ability to timely predict failures and intercept them before they occur is now a requirement.\n\nA possible solution to the problem can be found is in the huge volumes of diagnostic big data generated at hardware, firmware, middleware, application, storage and management layers indicating failures or errors. Machine analysis and understanding of this data is becoming an important part of debugging, performance analysis, root cause analysis and business analysis. In addition to preventing outages, machine data analysis can also provide insights for fraud detection, customer retention and other important use cases.\n\nThis Meetup is FREE.

SEATING IS LIMITED - REGISTER NOW.\n\nhttp://ibm.co/19APszk\n\nHive is a runtime Hadoop® support structure that allows anyone who is already fluent with SQL (which is commonplace for relational database developers) to leverage the Hadoop platform right out of the gate. Hive allows SQL developers to write Hive Query Language (HQL) statements that are similar to standard SQL statements. HQL statements are broken down by the Hive service into MapReduce jobs and executed across a Hadoop cluster.\n\nIBM® Big SQL is a data warehouse system for Hadoop that you use to summarize, query, and analyze data. Big SQL provides SQL access to data that is stored in InfoSphere® BigInsights™ by using JDBC or ODBC connections. Big SQL provides broad SQL support that is typical of commercial databases. You can issue JDBC queries or ODBC queries to access data that is stored in InfoSphere BigInsights, in the same way that you access databases from your enterprise applications.\n\nYou can use Big SQL to issue queries of any size, including concurrent queries. Big SQL provides support for large ad-hoc queries by using MapReduce parallelism and point queries, which are low-latency queries that return information quickly to reduce response time and provide improved access to data.\n\nHBase is a column-oriented database management system that runs on top of HDFS. It is well suited for sparse data sets, which are common in many big data use cases. Unlike relational database systems, HBase does not support a structured query language like SQL; in fact, HBase isn’t a relational data store at all. HBase applications are typically written in Java much like a MapReduce application or in other languages by using Apache Thrift. However, HBase can be queried with SQL when combined with Hive and or Big SQL!\n\nApache Accumulo, like HBase, derives from Google's BigTable technology. While the two technologies are similar in architecture, Accumulo excels in security right down to the cell level. Attendees will receive an introduction to Apache Accumulo and hear about IBM's Accumulo research project.\n\nJoin us from 11:00am - 6:00pm on February the 4th to learn about Big SQL, Hive and HBase. Register at: http://ibm.co/19APszk\n\nAttendees will learn how these three technologies complement each other and experience hands-on\n\nlab exercises to enhance your understanding.

This will be our first Meetup at the IBM office in San Jose.\n\nBig data projects are challenging for many reasons, from scoping out the business problems to be solved, getting the right skills in place, and showing value to the organization. For this reason, some organizations have avoided the tough conversation around managing risk, including the fundamental conversation around information governance, and how to meet data privacy and data security obligations.\n\nIn this meetup, our speakers will discuss some approaches to integrating information governance into typical big data projects that include the use of Hadoop for exploration and analysis. This includes metadata management, data masking while maintaining analytical integrity, and monitoring to detect potential internal/external breaches and for demonstrating compliance to specific audit requirements.\n\nAgenda:\n\n6:00pm-7pm: Networking (Food &amp; Beverages provided)\n\n7:00pm: Presentation\n\n7:45-8pm: Break\n\n8pm: Live Demo\n\n8:30pm: Networking","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/BigDataDevelopers/events/163490722/","yes_rsvp_count":103,"duration":10800000,"name":"Considerations for a Holistic Approach to Big Data Security and Privacy","time":1393552800000,"updated":1393603035000,"status":"past","group_id":4013112,"group_name":"Big Data Developers","lat":37.422306,"lon":-121.962448,"city":"San Jose","state":"CA","country":"us","_id":"163490722"},{"utc_offset":-21600000,"headcount":50,"visibility":"public","created":1391106916000,"rating":{"count":5,"average":4.400000095367432},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Participe en un exclusivo Big Data Developer Day, organizado por el equipo de Big Data de IBM.

The engine was developed by IBM research. IBM has been working in this area for many years and regularly work with customers to extend and enhance its capabilities.\n\nWhy and What is Text Analytics?\n\nText Analytics is a way to extract information from unstructured and semi-structured documents. By extracting information from these documents, you can combine it with other more traditional structured information to get a more complete view of your business, your customers and your competitors. Most text documents are written by people to convey information to other people so they don't follow strict rules controlling content, layout and style. As a result, you can't use traditional ETL tools to extract information from them. Call center records are a good example. They often include fields containing the text of a dialog with a customer and notes and comments made by the call center rep. There's lots of valuable information in these fields, but you can't extract it using ETL tools. The same is true for social media and sentiment data. These new data sources contain huge amounts of very valuable information about your business, your customers and your competitors, but if you want to extract meaningful information from data from blogs, tweets, call center records and other unstructured documents you need Text Analytics.\n\nUsing Text Analytics we can make it easier to intelligently search and access information from these documents and we can open up the information to traditional Business Intelligence and warehousing tools and technologies. Machines are very good at quickly applying unambiguous rules that can be precisely encoded; but processing documents using rule based or grammar based extraction techniques doesn’t work very well; there's just too much variability and these systems usually become ‘brittle’. IBM Text Analytics is based on a system that lets you identify elements of interest and their context without writing complex and fragile grammars and rules. Think of the way you scan a document, identifying information of interest, determining the context and then extracting the information you need. IBM Text Analytics uses a similar machine based model.","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Phoenix/events/169436992/","yes_rsvp_count":27,"name":"AQL - Annotator Query Language","time":1395279000000,"updated":1395290021000,"status":"past","group_id":8089392,"group_name":"Big Data Developers in Phoenix","lat":33.57708,"lon":-111.907684,"city":"Phoenix","state":"AZ","country":"us","_id":"169436992"},{"utc_offset":-21600000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1392906907000,"rating":{"count":4,"average":4.5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Welcome to greater Denver's inaugural Big Data/Hadoop meetup.

Doors open at 8:00 am for registration and networking, while the program starts at 9:00 am.\n\nWith smart phones and fully instrumented cars, the amount of data we can collect from moving objects is growing at staggering rates. In a few years, the automotive industry will be the largest data producer of data after utilities -- bigger than health care. And with this Big Data volume comes Big Data challenges. The opportunity for applying all this data in real-time to problems in transportation, congestion management, emergency response, microweather prediction, supply chain management, and so on is tremendous. But this requires a real-time analytics platform that can integrate GPS locations, telematics messages and sensor readings, video, and other kinds of information--and scale up to any level. Beyond automotive applications, the need for a real-time big-data analytics platform is becoming critical in other industries, including Government, Telecommunications, Healthcare, Energy and Utilities, Finance, and Manufacturing.\n\nBring your laptop, because you'll have an opportunity to get hands-on with InfoSphere Streams and apply this exciting new technology yourself! If you're not ready to get your hands dirty, that's OK. We'll also be showing an additional deep dive demo of how to build a real-time analytics application.\n\nAgenda\n\n8:00 am - Doors Open - Registration and Welcome\n\n9:00 am - Introduction to Real Time Analytics\n\n9:30 am - Demo and Lab Introduction\n\n10:00 am - Intro to Streams using Visual Programming Eclipse Hands-on Lab\n\nor\n\nAdditional Toolkit labs for folks who attended previous Intro to Streams event\n\n12:00 pm - Lunch\n\n1:00 pm - Introduction to coding Real Time Analytics applications with SPL\n\n2:00 pm - SPL Hands-on Lab\n\n6:00 pm - Close and Thank You for Attending\n\nIf you plan to participate in the hands-on labs, please bring your own laptops. Some additional details here:\n\nBring your own laptop. Download the Streams Quick Start Edition VMware image: ibm.co/streamsqs\n\nThe Streams Quick Start Edition is free. There is no data capacity and no time limitation, so you can experiment with large data sets and work with different use cases, on your own timeframe.\n\nIf you've never run a VMware image before, you'll need VMPlayer (Windows/Linux) or VMFusion (Mac).\n\nThis short demo will take you step by step through the Streams Quick Start Edition setup: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2L4DNZQAwk\n\nIf you want to get a head start, check out the new Streams developer community: ibm.co/streamsdev\n\nWe look forward to seeing you there.

From such diverse sources as social media feeds, Call Detail Records (CDRs), consumer transactions, financial markets, machine sensors, etc., streaming data is present in virtually every modern business process and social interaction. However, the sheer speed and volume of this data type makes it difficult to leverage using conventional systems.\n\nTypically, there is too much data to collect, store, and analyze in a timely fashion. By the time data is stored on disk and analyzed, the response is no longer relevant. Organizations need a system that captures the value of streaming data in near-real-time and transforms it into actionable insight. – Enter IBM InfoSphere® Streams.\n\nStreams processing is a new computing model that affects the “when,” “where,” and “how” of enterprise data analysis. By processing data as soon as it is captured, the enterprise can react rapidly to events as they occur, resulting in optimized business outcomes. From increased customer retention; to earlier fraud detection; to more productive cross-selling, the benefits of streams processing are many. IBM InfoSphere Streams uses innovative technology to perform rapid real-time analysis of information originating from a myriad of disparate sources resulting in positive outcomes for the enterprise. This Meet-Up session introduces participants to the capabilities of the IBM InfoSphere® Streams platform. The objective of this session is to demonstrate, via simple use cases, the features of the InfoSphere Streams platform.

While NoSQL offersdynamic elasticity with data and its organization, these databases lack essentialelements common to enterprise class databases. Today, IBM offers a solution that can natively handle NoSQL and structured data simultaneously giving you the flexibility and development speed of NoSQL with all the features andcharacteristics of an enterprise class database.\n\nThis roadshow will help you understand how application developers can use fullNoSQL functionality (including sharding) for complete plug-and-play compatibility with MongoDB and graph-store databases. They can access structured and unstructured data in a single statement and join them together as needed. These applications can use the enterprise-level capabilities of a structured database system including transaction support, backup and recovery, H/A, compression, enhanced scalability, security and access control.

This will be our first Meetup at the IBM office in Cambridge.\n\nBig data projects are challenging for many reasons, from scoping out the business problems to be solved, getting the right skills in place, and showing value to the organization. For this reason, some organizations have avoided the tough conversation around managing risk, including the fundamental conversation around information governance, and how to meet data privacy and data security obligations.\n\nIn this meetup, our speakers will discuss some approaches to integrating information governance into typical big data projects that include the use of Hadoop for exploration and analysis. This includes metadata management, data masking while maintaining analytical integrity, and monitoring to detect potential internal/external breaches and for demonstrating compliance to specific audit requirements.\n\nAgenda:\n\n6:00pm-7pm: Networking (Food &amp; Beverages provided)\n\n7:00pm: Presentation\n\n7:45-8pm: Break\n\n8pm: Live Demo\n\n8:30pm: Networking","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Boston/events/184373932/","yes_rsvp_count":58,"duration":9000000,"name":"Considerations for a Holistic Approach to Big Data Security and Privacy","time":1402437600000,"updated":1402499282000,"status":"past","group_id":9505222,"group_name":"Big Data Developers in Boston","lat":42.365734,"lon":-71.07682,"city":"Cambridge","state":"MA","country":"us","_id":"184373932"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1400250010000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":4.329999923706055},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Come join the first Meetup for the Baton Rouge Bluemix Developers.

Come for networking and Food at 6:30 PM and we'll get started at 7:00 PM. We look forward to seeing you there!\n\nWhen considering SQL-on-Hadoop, the most fundamental question is: What is the right tool for the job? For interactive queries that require a few seconds (or even milliseconds) of response time, MapReduce (MR) is the wrong choice. On the other hand, for queries that require massive scale and runtime fault tolerance, an MR framework works well. MR was built for large-scale processing on big data, viewed mostly as “batch” processing.\n\nAs enterprises start using Apache Hadoop as a central data repository for all data — originating from sources as varied as operational systems, sensors, smart devices, metadata and internal applications — SQL processing becomes an optimal choice. A fundamental reason is that most enterprise data management and analytical tools rely on SQL.\n\nAs a tool for interactive query execution, SQL processing (of relational data) benefits from decades of research, usage experience and optimizations. Clearly, the SQL skills pool far exceeds that of MR developers and data scientists. As a general-purpose processing framework, MR may still be appropriate for ad hoc analytics, but that is as far as it can go with current technology.","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Phoenix/events/187561372/","yes_rsvp_count":38,"name":"Leverage what you already know with - SQL on Hadoop","time":1403141400000,"updated":1403213402000,"status":"past","group_id":8089392,"group_name":"Big Data Developers in Phoenix","lat":33.57708,"lon":-111.907684,"city":"Scottsdale","state":"AZ","country":"us","_id":"187561372"},{"utc_offset":7200000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1400670065000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Meetup at DevOps Days Amsterdam with Bluemix workshops, demos and more.

How about enhancing Public Safety by empowering first responders with near-real time information in the context of fire, floods and other natural disasters.\n\nAs enterprises seek to gain operational efficiencies and competitive advantage through greater use of analytics, much of the new information they need to analyze is found in text documents, increasingly, in a wide variety of social media sites and portals.\n\nDuring this meet-up, we will demonstrate two major Hadoop components:\n\n• Text Analytics in Hadoop powered by Annotator Query Language (AQL). AQL is a powerful declarative, rule-based language for the extraction of information from text documents.\n\n• Spreadsheet for Hadoop powered by BigSheets. BigSheets is a unique visualization and analysis tool designed to quickly build and publish charts and graphs for Big Data Applications.\n\nWe will have several demos. The demos will show you how you can store and analyze large volumes of current &amp; historical social media and reference data. You'll see how raw datasets can be ingested and analyzed in real time. This talk and demo will provide an introduction to Text-Analytics and BigSheets, and how it is used within the IBM Big Data platform.\n\nThis Meetup is FREE.

But there’s a difference between \"playing\" with big data versus solving real problems. The reality is that Hadoop alone might not be enough. Experience IBM’s enterprise-class Hadoop product, InfoSphere BigInsights, which enhances open source Hadoop with required enterprise capabilities including: analytics, visualization, security, standard SQL, enterprise HBase, developer/admin tools, learn about the role of Big Data in Motion, Big Data Exploration and more. The morning session will include interactive Big Data use case discussions, an overview of what is big data, live demonstrations of key Big Data components (Big Data at Rest, Big Data in Motion).\n\nIn the afternoon, get hands-on with Big Data using InfoSphere BigInsights Quick Start Edition and InfoSphere Streams Quick Start Edition with guidance from development experts. This is a unique opportunity to develop skills and learn about exciting technologies and techniques that you can immediately take back to your organization.\n\nThis event is FREE.

The talk will look at the \"aaS\" landscape, what you can do with Cloudant and how integrating Cloudant and BlueMix can really supercharge your applications.\n\nSimon Metson is the Product Director, Cloudant (anIBM® company). When asked to introduce himself, he said:\n\n\"I’m Simon Metson, a lapsed particle physicist, a product director at Cloudant (now an IBM® company), and a project committer on Apache CouchDB. For 10 years I worked on the distributed computing system for one of the Large Hadron Collider experiments, dealing with petabytes of relational and non-relational data. I'm now a product director at Cloudant, since joining in March 2012, focussing on making our service run smoothly and scale massively\"\n\nIBM DevOps Services - not just code (Anthony Kesterton)\n\nIBM DevOps Services is a planning and development environment for IBM BlueMix, and other technologies.

He's also a proud Zend Certified Engineer and writes about PHP integration with IBM software for developerWorks and Redbooks. Daniel has run monthly New York PHP user group meetings since 2004 and established the NYC Cloud Foundry meetup in 2013. He currently delivers IBM Bluemix innovation based on the OpenStack and Cloud Foundry open source projects.","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/nyc-cloud-foundry/events/162806682/","yes_rsvp_count":30,"name":"Cloud Foundry for PHP Developers (Joint event with NYPHP)","time":1411511400000,"updated":1411527496000,"status":"past","group_id":11153092,"group_name":"New York City Cloud Foundry Meetup","lat":40.762196,"lon":-73.972755,"city":"New York","state":"NY","country":"us","_id":"162806682"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1410966746000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Nos reuniremos en UCINF en Auditorio 202","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Santiago-PaaS-Bluemix-and-Cloud-Computing-Meetup/events/207806132/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Bluemix Overview","time":1411588800000,"updated":1411600450000,"status":"past","group_id":15546382,"group_name":"Santiago PaaS, Bluemix and Cloud Computing Meetup","lat":-33.42741,"lon":-70.610756,"city":"Santiago","country":"cl","_id":"207806132"},{"utc_offset":-25200000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1409953481000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Greg Morgan, Programmer/Analyst III from City of Phoenix will be our featured presenter:6:30PM - Introductions / Networking / Pizza &amp; Salad7:10PM - Presentation* A short introduction to City of Phoenix Planning and Development* A survey of GIS in the neo-geographer world* Using GIS keys in an OLAP environment.* Some thoughts on how to apply Hadoop and other Spatial / Analytical Tools","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Phoenix/events/205455122/","yes_rsvp_count":39,"name":"Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Big Data In Government ","time":1411608600000,"updated":1411642111000,"status":"past","group_id":8089392,"group_name":"Big Data Developers in Phoenix","lat":33.57708,"lon":-111.907684,"city":"Scottsdale","state":"AZ","country":"us","_id":"205455122"},{"utc_offset":-25200000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1408643405000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"REMINDER: EVEN THO YOU HAVE RSVP'D HERE, YOU MUST REGISTER AT THE LINK BELOW TO CONFIRM YOUR SEAT.\n\nJoin us for our next Big Data Developer Meetup at our regular, very popular local brewery.

Today, we have released a raft of cognitive services on bluemix.net, and we're partnering with (and in some cases funding) startups that build cognitive applications. I'll break down the core capabilities — what Watson can and can't do today and on our immediate roadmap — so that teams can know with some precision what they can do with Watson now.\n\nMeet the speaker:\n\nJohn Wolpert, Product Line Manager and Evangelist, Watson Ecosystem at IBM Watson Group\n\nJohn Wolpert leads product development for the Watson Ecosystem, with responsibility for setting the development roadmap, curating and ensuring the quality of available services, and keeping the organization focused sharply on the user. He also crafts and tells the Watson story to partners, leaders and audiences world-wide, using that regular contact with people outside IBM to gain insights for innovating and improving the end-to-end Ecosystem experience. He works out of the IBM Bluemix Garage incubator in San Francisco, where he has access to dozens of startups every day.\n\nJohn is a three-time entrepreneur and founder of the popular Taxi App, Flywheel. He has created new lines of business for several Fortune 100 companies, ran an international consortium of research labs, and has been an IBMer three times — in the past running the ground-breaking alphaWorks organization and the Extreme Blue incubator lab, one of the most patented labs in IBM history. John has taught Lean Startup practices at UC Berkeley, and his work on collaborative business model innovation is published in Harvard Business Review and Harvard Business School Press. He has delivered keynotes to the Australian Parliament, the European Commission, and for numerous corporate and top industry events.\n\nAgenda[masked]pm: Registration &amp; Networking6:[masked]pm: Introductions7:00-7:45pm: Tech Talk7:[masked]pm: Q&amp;A session","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/IBM-Watson-and-Cognitive-Computing/events/217818542/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"name":"IBM Watson, Building on Innovation (hosted by The Hive)","time":1415239200000,"updated":1415251410000,"status":"past","group_id":12742492,"group_name":"IBM Watson and Cognitive Computing","lat":37.408524,"lon":-122.151321,"city":"Palo Alto ","state":"CA","country":"us","_id":"217818542"},{"utc_offset":28800000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1415112844000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Agenda\n\nDuration: 3-4 hours\n\n§Connecting our Bodies to the Cloud - Technical Breakdown\n\n§Architecture of the Solution\n\n§Open Cloud environment with IBM Bluemix\n\n§Connected devices\n\n§Usage of IBM Bluemix Services\n\n§Building the Analytics layer\n\n§Hands on Lab\n\n§SPSS Demo\n\n§Wrap up","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Shanghai/events/217566502/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"Big Data Analytics in Detail","time":1415251800000,"updated":1415263086000,"status":"past","group_id":17917152,"group_name":"Big Data Developers in Shanghai","lat":0,"lon":0,"city":"Xi'an","country":"cn","_id":"217566502"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1414592544000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"InfoSphere BigInsights is IBM's solution to leverage the power of Hadoop to manage a wide variety of structured, unstructured and semi-structured data.

Our IoT Kitchen is Broken”\n\nThis is a tale of raw data becoming a gourmet meal, served restaurant-style. I won't talk about silver bullets or unicorns. Instead, I will focus on the long path of data bits from devices and sensors to the consumer. Along the way we will identify 4 levels of IoT maturity. We will also look at an S&amp;P 500 company en route through the journey of digital transformation using Docker containers, Cloud Foundry-based microservices and IoT-based business model.\n\nAbout speaker:\n\nRenat Khasanshyn is CEO of Altoros Systems and Venture Partner at Runa Capital. Employing one of the largest pools of Cloud Foundry engineering expertise on the market, Altoros brings “software assembly lines” and \"data lakes\" into organizations through training, deployment and integration of solutions offered by the Cloud Foundry ecosystem.\n\n2) Using Bluemix, IBM Internet of Things Foundation Clous and Cloudant for building scalable IoT apps\n\nWhat's all the buzz about Internet of Things (IoT)? What can be done with all that data? Come and see the demonstration of sensor data from a variety of devices ( Simulated sensor from IBM Internet of Things Cloud, Arduino with light sensor, RaspberryPi with temperature sensor)\n\nAlso see how the Sensor generated data is then made useful by storing in a Cloudant database and then performing analysis\n\nAbout speakers:\n\nAnimesh Singh, Syed Zaidi, Dwight Ford and Nicholas Vargas are part of Bluemix Team, and leading several innovations on Open Source technologies like Cloud Foundry, OpenStack and Docker","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Bluemix/events/206223082/","yes_rsvp_count":42,"name":"Building scalable IoT apps using Cloud Foundry, Containers, Bluemix & Cloudant","time":1416362400000,"updated":1416433195000,"status":"past","group_id":14266662,"group_name":"Bay Area PaaS, Cloud Foundry & BlueMix Meetup","_id":"206223082"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","created":1414036242000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"This is an IBM sponsored Big Data meetup group.

Maybe do a bit of a demo too...\n\nBeverages and light snacks will be served.","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Vancouver/events/218684147/","yes_rsvp_count":34,"duration":7200000,"name":"Lessons Learned: Real Deployment of Hadoop (with GPFS)","time":1416438000000,"updated":1416458452000,"status":"past","group_id":14038802,"group_name":"Big Data Developers in Vancouver","lat":49.284981,"lon":-123.11084,"city":"Vancouver","state":"BC","country":"ca","_id":"218684147"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1413826603000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Agenda\n\n6:30pm - 7pm: Pre-meeting conversation, networking, light refreshments 7pm - 8:30pm: Presentation, Q&amp;A\n\nAbstract\n\nhybris [y] is a software vendor specialized in multichannel ecommerce and product content management (PCM) software. hybris was founded in 1997 and got acquired by SAP in 2013 . Hybris is considered as a leader in the enterprise multichannel commerce and e-commerce market by industry analyst firms Forrester Research, Gartner and Ventana Research.\n\n[y]aaS is a multi tenant cloud platform which allows everyone to easily develop, extend and sell commerce services and apps. [y]aaS is based on a steadily growing micro service architecture running on Cloud Foundry as foundation. All services within [y]aaS are exposed through a consistent RESTfull API. Beside the API [y]aas also includes a Marketplace for hybris services as well as 3rd party service, an On Demand Store Front and a Back office application, all running on Cloud Foundry.\n\nIn this talk we will share our experience developing such an architecture and how Cloud Foundry helped us to streamline and speed up our development. We will also touch certain aspects of the infrastructure built up around Cloud Foundry and our Micro Services, like Logging and Monitoring.\n\nSpeaker\n\nRené WelchesProduct Owner – PaaS Cloud Foundry at hybrisRené started with hybris last year in the On Demand Delivery area. This year René took over the Cloud Foundry topic within hybris. He and his team are not only setting up a Cloud Foundry practice within hybris but also contributing to the SAP Cloud Foundry initiative. If he is not working with Cloud Foundry he plays Capoeira, bikes throughout New York or tries to catch some of the few waves at Long Beach.","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/nyc-cloud-foundry/events/214585402/","yes_rsvp_count":42,"name":"Commerce as a (Micro-) Service with Cloud Foundry","time":1416439800000,"updated":1416451320000,"status":"past","group_id":11153092,"group_name":"New York City Cloud Foundry Meetup","lat":40.74021,"lon":-73.994774,"city":"New York","state":"NY","country":"us","_id":"214585402"},{"utc_offset":32400000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1415859287000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"IoT (モノのインターネット）について語り合います。\n\nRaspberry Piなどのデバイスとアプリの連携をされている方、ビジネスにしようとしている方、興味のある方、お集まりください。\n\nデバイスと連携させたアプリやその作り方などについて情報共有を行います。\n\n自身の経験を発表いただける方も大歓迎です。\n\n奮ってご参加ください。\n\n*参加希望の方は、右上の Join and RSVPをクリックして参加表明ください。","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Tokyo-PaaS-and-Bluemix-Meetup/events/218656760/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"IoT（モノのインターネット）アプリを経験しよう","time":1416477600000,"updated":1416488542000,"status":"past","group_id":16453302,"group_name":"IBM Bluemix Meetup Tokyo","lat":35.654144,"lon":139.70555,"city":"Tokyo","country":"jp","_id":"218656760"},{"utc_offset":-7200000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1414949380000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":4.5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Montevideo-PaaS-Bluemix-and-Cloud-Computing-Meetup/events/217154042/","yes_rsvp_count":16,"duration":7200000,"name":"Bluemix en TechMeetup","time":1416517200000,"updated":1416540693000,"status":"past","group_id":15581002,"group_name":"Montevideo PaaS, Bluemix & Cloud Computing Meetup","lat":-34.903809,"lon":-56.190594,"city":"Montevideo","country":"uy","_id":"217154042"},{"utc_offset":28800000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1415930087000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Big Data FoundationSmart Power GridsStreaming computing &amp; data minningdiscussion","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Shanghai/events/218672877/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"name":"Big Data & Smart Power Grids for Shanghai University Of Engineering Science","time":1416549600000,"updated":1416560458000,"status":"past","group_id":17917152,"group_name":"Big Data Developers in Shanghai","lat":0,"lon":0,"city":"Shanghai","country":"cn","_id":"218672877"},{"utc_offset":-28800000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1413291001000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"REGISTRATION FOR THIS EVENT IS NOW CLOSED.

The conference presents a unique all-day university conference featuring scientists and humanists, researchers and practitioners, faculty and students, from across the schools and disciplines at CGU and beyond. Panelists and invited speakers will address the question of \"Big Data, Better World?\" from different intellectual and professional vantage points. To register for the conference, go to this link: http://www.cgu.edu/bigdataconference\n\nOpen source Apache Hadoop is a great framework for distributed processing of large data sets. But there’s a difference between \"playing\" with Big Data versus solving real problems. The reality is that Hadoop alone might not be enough. Experience IBM’s enterprise-class Hadoop product, InfoSphere BigInsights, which enhances open source Hadoop with required enterprise capabilities including: analytics, visualization, security, standard SQL, enterprise HBase, developer/admin tools, learn about the role of Big Data in Motion, Big Data Exploration and more. This session will include interactive Big Data use case discussions, an overview of what is Big Data, live demonstrations of key Big Data components (Big Data at Rest, Big Data in Motion).\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B27SpLOOhWw\n\nand, hands-on with Big Data using InfoSphere BigInsights Quick Start Edition and InfoSphere Streams Quick Start Edition with guidance from development experts. This is a unique opportunity to develop skills and learn about exciting technologies and techniques that you can immediately take back to your organization.\n\nThis event is FREE.

The sign on the front of the building states \"Charles Park\" which can sometimes confuse guests. The auditorium is on the first floor.· Parking is located across the street at the Cambridgeside Galleria Mall located at 100 Cambridgeside Place. We can validate guest parking for a discounted rate if they are parked for longer than 5 hours (price drops from $20 to $11). · Below is a map that shows where the mall is in relation to the center. Once guests park their cars, they will take the elevator/escalator to the first floor of the mall. They will walk towards the end of the mall where the Cheesecake Factory and California Pizza Kitchen are located. The center is in the building directly across the street. Guests will have to walk along the side of the building, until they reach Rogers Street. From there, they will turn right and the front doors are located directly ahead.\n\nPUBLIC TRANSPORTATION· Lechmere Station (Green Line): Located .4 miles from center which is an 8 minute walk.· Kendall Square (Red Line): Located .8 miles from the center which is a 15 minute walk. The Cambridgeside Galleria Shuttle to and from Kendall Square runs every 20 minutes from 9AM to 8PM Monday through Sunday.","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Area-Cloud-Foundry-Meetup/events/219041772/","yes_rsvp_count":47,"name":"Cloud Foundry in Production: Use Cases, Limitations, Lessons Learned","time":1421105400000,"updated":1421181247000,"status":"past","group_id":10702282,"group_name":"The Boston Area Cloud Foundry Meetup","lat":42.365738,"lon":-71.07682,"city":"Cambridge","state":"MA","country":"us","_id":"219041772"},{"utc_offset":-10800000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1420641814000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Estimados Bluemixeros,Ya arrancamos el 2015 y quería invitarlos al webcast que tendremos el 14 de Enero sobre como desarrollar una aplicación iOS en Bluemix usando IBM MobileFirst Platform for iOS.\n\nAdjunto el link para que se registren (no tiene costo):\n\nhttps://ibm.biz/BlmxMobileFirst-Social","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Santiago-PaaS-Bluemix-and-Cloud-Computing-Meetup/events/219666834/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":7200000,"name":"WebCast: Como desarrollar una aplicación iOS en Bluemix","time":1421251200000,"updated":1421259849000,"status":"past","group_id":15546382,"group_name":"Santiago PaaS, Bluemix and Cloud Computing Meetup","_id":"219666834"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1418075523000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":4.5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Lecture Hall West, 2nd Floor\n\nAhead of the evening meetup, Dave Nielsen will run a three hour workshop to show you how to get started running your own Platform-as-a-Service with Cloud Foundry.\n\nThis workshop is free for NYC Cloud Foundry members (RSVP to this event here).

My undergraduate degree is in ‘Biochemistry’ and having started programming computers aged eight I did my Masters degree in Bioinformatics because the overlap of the fields interested me. I’ve worked in the Netherlands, my home country of the UK and in Canada on a range of topics in the field of Bioscience and medical research for the past few years. Most of these involved ‘data munging’ to interface pre-existing tools and packages to my own software or filtering strategies. Quite quickly I became interested in Data Management: better management = less munging &amp; better results with less pain. I have spent a lot of my time more recently assisting with the storage, transfer and security of the newer ‘Genomics’ data – specifically resulting from High Throughput DNA Sequencing - between international databases or consortia. My current roll is that of ‘Automation Engineer’ – aka. ‘Data Manager’ – at the OICR. Here I and the team are responsible safe and secure keeping of ~2 PB of data with a typical data set being in the ~20-50TB range","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Toronto/events/220304792/","yes_rsvp_count":74,"name":"Managing & Processing Big Data for Cancer Genomics, an insight of Bioinformatics","time":1423782000000,"updated":1424206308000,"status":"past","group_id":9505562,"group_name":"Big Data Developers in Toronto","lat":43.671299,"lon":-79.38382,"city":"Toronto","state":"ON","country":"ca","_id":"220304792"},{"utc_offset":-28800000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1423001818000,"rating":{"count":4,"average":4.75},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"REMINDER - SOCIAL GOOD AND BEER TASTING TONIGHT AT STRIKE BREWERS.

Two topics will be covered:\n\nTopic 1: Semi-automated human genome annotation\n\nAbstract: Sequence census methods like ChIP-seq now produce an unprecedented amount of genome-anchored data. We have developed an integrative method to identify patterns from multiple experiments simultaneously while taking full advantage of high-resolution data, discovering joint patterns across different assay types. We apply this method to ENCODE chromatin data for multiple human cell types, including ChIP-seq data on covalent histone modifications and transcription factor binding, and DNase-seq and FAIRE-seq readouts of open chromatin. In an unsupervised fashion, we identify patterns associated with transcription start sites, gene ends, enhancers, CTCF elements, and repressed regions. The method yields a model which elucidates the relationship between assay observations and functional elements in the genome. This model identifies sequences likely to affect transcription, and we verify these predictions in laboratory experiments. We have made software and an integrative genome browser track freely available (http://pmgenomics.ca/hoffmanlab/proj/segway/).\n\nSpeaker: Michael M. Hoffman (Assistant Professor in the Departments of Medical Biophysics and Computer Science, University of Toronto)\n\nTopic #2: Deep Autoencoder Neural Networks for Gene Ontology Annotation Predictions\n\nAbstract: The annotation of genomic information is a major challenge in biology and bioinformatics. Existing databases of known gene functions are incomplete and prone to errors, and the biomolecular experiments needed to improve these databases are slow and costly. While computational methods are not a substitute for experimental verification, they can help in two ways: algorithms can aid in the curation of gene annotations by automatically suggesting inaccuracies, and they can predict previously-unidentified gene functions, accelerating the rate of gene function discovery. In this work, we develop an algorithm that achieves both goals using deep autoencoder neural networks. With experiments on gene annotation data from the Gene Ontology project, we show that deep autoencoder networks achieve better performance than other standard machine learning methods, including the popular truncated singular value decomposition.\n\nSpeaker: Davide Chicco (postdoctoral fellow at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University of Toronto)","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Toronto/events/220871450/","yes_rsvp_count":35,"name":"Semi-automated human genome annotation","time":1425934800000,"updated":1426010849000,"status":"past","group_id":9505562,"group_name":"Big Data Developers in Toronto","lat":43.659801,"lon":-79.388748,"city":"Toronto","state":"ON","country":"ca","_id":"220871450"},{"utc_offset":-25200000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1422925846000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Registration required!Use this Link:https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13tpiXrNOTSM5APAgOeu_g2A7V3Bx3MxK598hUtkSIxk/viewform\n\nDo your software projects stumble over the deployment hurdle?

Today’s applications are expected to manage a variety of structured and unstructured data, accessed by massive networks of users, devices, and business locations, or even sensors, vehicles and Internet-enabled goods.\n\nIn today’s continuously changing, always connected business environment, you must make the best possible decisions and put them into action immediately. Real-time actionable insight provides the robust big data and analytics capabilities that allow you to capture, analyze and act on all relevant data, including the stream of data generated by the myriad devices that make up the Internet of Things. Marketers, sales managers, financial analysts and other business users gain the insights they need to act in real time based on timely, trusted data.\n\nAs you expand big data and analytics capabilities throughout your organization, you need to empower all of your business users to access and analyze data for faster insight. Taking delivery of software, solutions, infrastructure, platforms and services on the cloud can accelerate the value of big data and analytics capabilities, offering scalability with limited upfront investment.\n\nJoin us to learn about how IBM and Perficient are helping clients rapidly deliver solutions to Capture, Analyze and Act on IoT data in Real-Time. The Developer Day kicks off at 8:30am with food and beverages/registration.

In this role, Peter works closely with electronics &amp; appliance makers, auto OEMs &amp; industrial manufacturers to assist them in defining IoT strategy and roadmap -- architecting cutting edge IoT solutions utilizing the latest cloud-based technologies such as MQTT, real-time streaming, voice, cognitive and analytics. Peter enjoys helping customers innovate with IoT &amp; Bluemix. Prior to the current job, Peter had been in the IBM WebSphere middleware group for 15 years, holding various positions in consulting, technical sales and sales, which equipped him with deep technical skills in Java EE, Integration, SOA, BPM, API and Mobile technologies.\n\nTom Luczak - Co-Founder/Chief Technology Officer of flowthings.io\n\nTom’s love affair with all things computing, hardware, and communications began in the mid-80's. His passion growing while soldering upgrades into floppy drives and \"enhancing\" modems and phone lines to get better speed on his dial-up CompuServe connection.\n\nWhat started as a passion grew into a career years later while serving in the U.S. Army as an Electronic Warfare and Signals Intelligence Specialist and Linguist. As a Technical Director at an overseas location, Tom specialized in multiple analytic disciplines and participated in the creation and evaluation of several national-level intelligence products. He also earned Adjunct Faculty status at the National Cryptologic School and both co-authored and taught highly technical courses in several subject areas, including analytics, reporting, astrodynamics, and advanced radio theory. In short, he had a geektastic time.\n\nA couple of years later, (before most had heard the phrase \"Internet of Things\") Tom met Eric, and they decided to found a company called \"Flow\" with the vision of realtime data sharing between disparate systems in an agile way. Since that first meeting in a diner in Gramercy, Tom has loved every second of building the flowthings.io team and technology to realize that vision. He especially enjoys how his role lets him play with some neat hardware, get his hands dirty with a soldering iron, and constantly be amazed at the terminal effect a bunch of 1's and 0's flowing through the internet can have on the physical world.\n\nIn addition to his work on flowthings.io, Tom is the proud father of three smaller and better versions of himself and lives in Brooklyn with his wife and two dogs. He enjoys live music, complicated tabletop games, perforating paper from extreme distance and the study thereof, and making plans for the fully self-sustaining domicile he intends to build.","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/nyc-bluemix/events/221189701/","yes_rsvp_count":123,"duration":12600000,"name":"Internet of Things (IoT) on IBM Bluemix","time":1429047000000,"updated":1432681015000,"status":"past","group_id":15104552,"group_name":"New York City Bluemix meetup","_id":"221189701"},{"utc_offset":-25200000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1426646443000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Registration will close April 16th.

Imagine if you could find new, related pathways in your data to make discoveries in a fraction of the time you could before. This is the power of what can be achieved with Cognitive Computing. Quick test, ask your phone “find anything but pizza restaurants”. Did you get back a list of pizza restaurants? Think about how we’ve been trained to keyword search. We have all been Google-fied &amp; we may not even know it. Humans adapt their language, one that predates machines, to the limitations of a system.\n\nIBM Watson, the cognitive technology that enhances, scales, &amp; accelerates human expertise. Watson's cognitive capabilities on Bluemix will enhance apps &amp; help developers realize ideas not possible with today's systems. Watson is not a machine that lets us talk to it. It’s bigger, and that’s why this is a historic moment for developers, businesses &amp; entrepreneurs. IBM is creating tools that can understand language, determine a personality portrait, expand concepts &amp; more. In this session we will discuss &amp; demo Watson Services on Bluemix &amp; how developers can now embed these into their apps for unprecedented cognitive power.\n\nSpeaker Bio\n\nSwami Chandrasekaran (@swamichandra) is as an Executive Architect and technical leader in the IBM Watson CTO Office. In this role, he sets &amp; drives the technical agenda for cognitive computing, and works with customers on building IBM Watson-based cognitive, analytics &amp; big data solutions.

The objective of this association was to promote open source-based big data technologies, optimize the testing across the ecosystem vendors, and accelerate the ability of enterprises to build or implement data-driven applications. In this presentation, Rakesh, as an expert in IBM BigInsights (IBM's Hadoop Distribution), will provide a brief overview of the major open source Hadoop tecnologies, how ODP integrates them, and how you can benefit in participatiing with, and adoption of, ODP. You will also learn how IBM incorporates ODP, and further expands on this platform with the addition of enterprise-rich features with BigInsigts 4.0.","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Phoenix/events/222076884/","yes_rsvp_count":53,"name":"The Move to Open Source Hadoop","time":1432171800000,"updated":1432275051000,"status":"past","group_id":8089392,"group_name":"Big Data Developers in Phoenix","lat":33.57708,"lon":-111.907684,"city":"Scottsdale","state":"AZ","country":"us","_id":"222076884"},{"utc_offset":-25200000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1429655891000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Special Guest Confirmed: James Watters\n\nPlease join us for this special event in which Java experts, Jeff Holmes and Scott Deeg, review some of the newest innovations in Cloud Foundry.\n\nTopics\n\n• Cloud Foundry Summit Highlights http://www.cfsummit.com/\n\n• Demonstration of building a SPA (single page application) application using a Polymer front-end (Google's WebComponents framework) and a Java/Spring backend.

In this session we will install and configure a Hadoop cluster in a cloud environment provided by Evolving Solutions. We will discuss common enterprise use cases and the preparation and planning needed to ensure a cluster meets the needs of your organization. Take this opportunity to better understand the infrastructure challenges and considerations for Hadoop in your business, without having to build your own lab. This hands-on workshop is designed for System Admins, Infrastructure Architects and Big Data Enthusiasts.\n\nThis workshop is a customer event. In order to confirm your registration for this workshop, please go to this link: http://ibm.co/1b84KO7\n\nWhat is Hadoop? Apache™ Hadoop® is an open source software project that enables distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of commodity servers. It is designed to scale up from a single server to thousands of machines, with very high degree of fault tolerance. Rather than relying on high-end hardware, the resiliency of these clusters comes from the software's ability to detect and handle failures at the application layer.\n\nPlease bring your own laptop for this workshop. An IBM Softlayer cloud environment will be provided to get you started. Questions about the cloud environment can be directed to Amber Murphy at [masked].\n\nThe workshop will begin at 12:00 pm with registration and lunch and will conclude at 5:00 pm.

For example, a business analyst needs to quickly find relevant information, the data scientist needs to make sense of the data with statistical modeling, and the whole environment needs to be easy for IT to manage and deploy for everyone to use. As the size and complexity of Hadoop applications continues to grow, data science has become a critical function for unlocking meaningful insights and identifying actions that could optimize outcomes across the entire business.\n\nIn February 2015, several diverse companies launched an initiative aimed to define a core platform that will enable faster development and wider enterprise adoption of big data projects. The Open Data Platform (ODP), according to the founding members, is an industry association assembled to promote open-source data initiatives, particularly those revolving around the Hadoop analytics framework.\n\nJoin us on June 8th at 6:30 pm (immediately after the Hadoop Summit Reception at the Marriott Hotel - Salons 1-4 - 5:00 pm to 6:00 pm) at the San Jose Convention Center - Room LL21A to hear several Open Data Platform (ODP) founding members talk about the innovation with the platform and the exciting opportunities to engage.\n\nHadoop Summit Reception - Marriott Hotel (attached to Convention Center) - Salons 1-4.

We have a great speaker: Chip Childers, Technology Chief of Staff, Cloud Foundry Foundation.\n\nTitle: The Makings of a Modern Application Architecture\n\nIt wasn’t too long ago that artisans, bathed in the glow of molten metal, forged parts that would go on to make up bigger, more powerful machines. Today, we call those artisans developers. Instead of metal, they use bits and bytes in the cloud to forge a modern application architecture that supports public, private and hybrid application deployment. One that enables users and developers to move their applications wherever they need to go. And it’s built on a growing, vibrant ecosystem.\n\nNowhere is this epic shift in how things are made more visible than the meteoric adoption of Cloud Foundry. In this talk, Cloud Foundry technology chief of staff Chip Childers will give attendees an inside look at the economic forces that have made Cloud Foundry the fastest growing open source project in history.\n\nHe will also provide a look at the technologies driving this new level of efficiency for application developers (tech like containers, Docker, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Cloud Foundry and social coding tools like GitHub). And he’ll explain why many prominent members of the Fortune 500 are building their futures on this modern application architecture.\n\nSpeaker: Chip Childers, Technology Chief of Staff, Cloud Foundry Foundation","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Area-Cloud-Foundry-Meetup/events/222987928/","yes_rsvp_count":43,"name":"The Makings of a Modern Application Architecture","time":1434058200000,"updated":1434112561000,"status":"past","group_id":10702282,"group_name":"The Boston Area Cloud Foundry Meetup","lat":42.364799,"lon":-71.088791,"city":"Cambridge","state":"MA","country":"us","_id":"222987928"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1432907075000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"On June 12th, at The Frontier, a co-location space on Park Offices Drive in RTP, we will host an all-day event open to anyone interested in going deeper with Bluemix.

In days past it might take weeks or months to create an app. With IBM's new Bluemix cloud based Platform-as-a-Service, software developers can now build apps in hours or days rather than in weeks or months.\n\nIn cooperation with Cube and Bio-AM, IBM invites you to participate in a Bluemix \"Code Jam\" from 5 - 8 pm on June 15. The event will be held at the Cube at 328 S. Broadway in Rochester. Come learn about Bluemix, IBM's new cloud development platform. As part of this code jam you will be able to learn the fundamentals of building and deploying your application in the Cloud.\n\nIn the Jam we will have a number of ideas, but if you have been thinking of an app you would like to create and are willing to share it with the event community then please send us your idea. Maybe you have an idea of a new way to use social data, or a cognitive computing idea, or something related to Internet of Things. Whatever it might be, let us know and we may use them for the event. Please submit your idea by sending a Meetup message or email directly to Matt Paschal ([masked]).\n\nLeveraging IBM Bluemix, you can take your idea or problem, design it, and create it all in the cloud. IBM experts will be on hand to help coach you in how to use Bluemix to create your applications.\n\nIf you would like to try out IBM Bluemix before the Jam, you can sign up here: ibm.biz/Rochester_Meetup.\n\nRemember to bring your laptop, because we will be doing live coding.

If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.\n\nSpark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more.\n\nDo you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine?

Often the first idea of unstructured data seems to be that it's probably text data, even though that is just a small part. A lot of that \"new data\" is sensor data and especially multimedia (audio, video). Even though this part is growing extremely fast, it is very rarely used in analytics today. And even less in a real time context.\n\nI will demonstrate what does it mean to work with this new data in real time on a live demo and explain important concepts &amp; implementation approaches. The demo shows a drill equipment as it is used to build tunnels and how to analyze the output on the conveyor belt visually with machine learning approaches.

Please see above for place and time. Additional information can be found at: http://www.meetup.com/LA-Open-Data/events/223365549/\n\nJoin us to discuss recent Spark development trends, and go over some use cases of using Spark for analytics and machine learning.On June 15–17, I attended the 2015 Spark Summit and was excited to observe some new developments. The Spark Summit in last year had only about 500 attendees, for this year, the summit had more than 2000 attendees with many good use cases presented. More info about this summit is available at https://spark-summit.org/2015/ .\n\nThe Chief Information Officer from the Central Intelligence Agency, Doug Wolfe, also spoke at the Spark summit, about open data and about adopting big data technologies in government. It seems Spark could be very useful to process all the open data available, and I was told some venture capital funds have been created specially for the open data and public sector analytics, with the $100 Million SineWave Venture Fund as one example.\n\nAnd as announced at the Spark summit, IBM made a huge commitment to Spark, with a Spark Technology Center to be established in San Francisco that IBM will put thousands of data scientists and researchers into Spark development and has already made the IBM machine learning package, SystemML, open source to be integrated into Spark. For more, you may visit http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/spark/.\n\nSo, let us meet on July 8th evening to discuss:\n\n1) Spark development trends\n\n2) Spark analytics use cases\n\n3) Spark and open data\n\n4) Spark and machine learning tools\n\nAs before, Starbucks coffee and cookies will be provided. The meeting will start at 7pm sharp, and we will have Q&amp;A sessions and networking time following the talk / presentation.\n\nParking along the Brand Blvd costs about $1 per hour, and you may find free parking in nearby small streets.","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Los-Angeles/events/223443493/","yes_rsvp_count":48,"duration":7200000,"name":"Spark Trends and Spark Analytics","time":1436407200000,"updated":1436415760000,"status":"past","group_id":9505412,"group_name":"Big Data Developers in Los Angeles","_id":"223443493"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1432232324000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"This is a great chance to discuss the cloud basics to get started, as well as, for more advanced users what are some of the Open and Enterprise resources in the Bluemix cloud.

The gold standard for business strategy for many years was “sustainable competitive advantage” - capturing a market or niche through and then extending that advantage. Companies following this script are going out of business. Those companies who have thrived through the shifts in human behavior resulting from the digital revolution are using a different script: focus on continuous innovation.\n\nContinuous innovation is a core set of corporate practices that involve strategy leadership and operational iteration; it includes continuous reconfiguration, options valuation, healthy disengagement, but, above all, building an innovation proficiency.\n\nIn the frame of digital transformation, the innovation proficiency is what we must envision and practice. The leading edge of this practice is pairing “cloud native applications” with “continuous delivery of business value,” as pioneered by Amazon and Netflix, and now demonstrated by many others including Allstate, GE, and Lockheed Martin.\n\nCloud native applications are run in the cloud and on myriad input and output devices, built from scratch with assumptions of mobile and IoT clients. These also use information and processes from legacy systems (“systems of record”) but do so in a way that protects rather than exposes them; cloud native applications should run against a “digital platform”.\n\nContinuous delivery of business value is the right-sizing of digital innovation. Like the lean manufacturing movement in Japan, it shrinks the size of the tools and team to focus on cycle time optimization rather than volume of production. There are two key dimensions: people and tools. The people dimension is realized by creating 8-10 person groups that break silos with members of every type of organization on a single team.\n\nThese people and tools come together to build a stack of practices: continuous integration, continuous deployment, and continuous innovation - a system in which collective experience across the team and its customers is rapidly iterated to deliver more business value with each turn of the cycle.\n\nThese practices appear to be an empirically demonstrated pattern for successful digital transformation: continuous innovation supported by an enterprise digital platform.","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Area-Cloud-Foundry-Meetup/events/223460141/","yes_rsvp_count":57,"duration":7200000,"name":"Continuous Innovation and Digital Platforms- Speaker: Sam Ramji","time":1436479200000,"updated":1436565527000,"status":"past","group_id":10702282,"group_name":"The Boston Area Cloud Foundry Meetup","lat":42.364799,"lon":-71.088791,"city":"Cambridge","state":"MA","country":"us","_id":"223460141"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1432399830000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":1},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Les propongo que nos volvamos a reunir a comienzos de Julio y quiero saber de qué temas quisieran hablar:* Alta disponibilidad* Estrategias de backups y Recuperación de desastres\n\n* Seguridad\n\nSi alguien quiere mostrar un caso de uso puntual, aquí es bienvenido.\n\nQuién propone un lugar para que nos reunamos?","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/ColDUG/events/222732896/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Reunión trimestral de ColDUG","time":1436484600000,"updated":1436497066000,"status":"past","group_id":18432585,"group_name":"ColDUG: Grupo de Usuarios de DB2 en Colombia","lat":4.61619,"lon":-74.06756,"city":"Bogotá","country":"CO","_id":"222732896"},{"utc_offset":28800000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1400563937000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Tesla, BMW i8, they are very modern &amp; fashion to cars, not only a new car, also a revolution for automotive industry.\n\nBut, there is a big gap to such electronic cars, \"power provider\".\n\nLet's image, if those electronic cars can't get power as easy as fuel now for traditional cars, the revolution couldn't go further.\n\nIt will must be happened in the near future.

We will also discuss other Spark-related projects, including Spark SQL, MLlib, GraphX and Spark Streaming. The meetup includes introductions to the various Spark features, case studies from users, best practices for deployment and tuning, and updates on development.\n\nApache Spark is an open source processing engine built around speed, ease of use, and analytics. If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative. Spark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development.\n\nAgenda\n\nVenue -The Leela Palace Bangalore, 23, Old Airport Road, KodihalliBengaluru, Karnataka\n\nPlease register here to get your free Bluemix account\n\n1) In order to get the most out of this meetup, we strongly encourage you to register for your free 30 day trial of Bluemix if you haven't done so already.

In days past it might take weeks or months to create an app. With IBM's Bluemix cloud based Platform-as-a-Service, software developers can now build apps in hours or days rather than in weeks or months.\n\nIn cooperation with the Mayo Clinic Business Accelerator (MCBusAccel), IBM invites you to participate in a Bluemix Meetup from 5 - 7 pm on Sept. 15. The event will be held at MCBusAccel at 221 1st Avenue SW Suite 202 in Rochester. Come learn about Bluemix, IBM's new cloud development platform. As part of this Meetup you will be able to learn the fundamentals of building and deploying an application in the Cloud.\n\nIf you have attended any of our previous Meetups at the Cube, UMR, RCTC, or IBM then you will benefit from this one by learning how to build on what you have already learned about Bluemix. For beginners, we will be offering a \"Starters Tutorial\" and for more experienced Bluemixers, we will have an \"Advanced Tutorial.\"\n\nAlso, if you have been thinking of an app you would like to create then you can try it out on Bluemix during the meeting. Maybe you have an idea of a new way to use social data, or a cognitive computing idea, or something related to Internet of Things.

Il tutto in un weekend!Lo startup weekend WineAPPathon si svolgerà a partire dal pomeriggio di venerdì 18 settembre, includendo nozioni tecniche sulla piattaforma di sviluppo, l’esposizione delle idee e la costituzione dei team, per proseguire sabato 19 e domenica 20 mattina con lo sviluppo delle idee e del prototipo; il tutto presso la sede di Talent Garden a Milano.Nella tarda mattinata di domenica 20 settembre, una commissione di esperti, formata da rappresentanti AIS, IBM, produttori di vini, il mondo dei media e l’ecosistema che ruota intorno alle start up, riconoscerà e premierà l’idea più innovativa.Non solo, durante il Congresso annuale AIS (14-15 Novembre 2015 a Milano) ci sarà l’occasione per ripercorrere i principali momenti di questo evento e ascoltare dalla voce dei protagonisti l’esposizione delle idee più innovative.Le iscrizioni sono aperte dal giorno 8 luglio al seguente indirizzo: www.SWwine.talentgarden.itPer informazioni potete contattare [masked]","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Milan-PaaS-Bluemix-Meetup/events/223786036/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Startup weekend - Wine Edition: il primo AIS WineAPPathon","time":1442584800000,"updated":1442597366000,"status":"past","group_id":18507883,"group_name":"Milan PaaS & Bluemix Meetup","lat":45.497551,"lon":9.221184,"city":"Milano","country":"it","_id":"223786036"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1434410617000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"We will have two IBM Cloud Architects available to answer any questions you may have about IBM Bluemix, IBM Softlayer and the IBM Marketplace.\n\nWe can also talk about general Cloud Architecture questions and within reason about IBM Watson and other services available in IBM Bluemix.\n\nBring your questions, grab a bite at one of the Food Trucks and bring any questions you would like answered.","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/rtpbluemix/events/224767966/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":7200000,"name":"Cloud / Bluemix Technical Office Hours","time":1442588400000,"updated":1442597502000,"status":"past","group_id":16226272,"group_name":"Triangle Bluemix Meetup","lat":35.896862,"lon":-78.871201,"city":"Durham","state":"NC","country":"us","_id":"sjprhlytmbxb"},{"utc_offset":-25200000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1440795813000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Want to win $5,000 in cash prizes and the opportunity to present your final project to a panel of Judges at IBM Insight 2015 in Las Vegas?\n\nCheck out more here: http://hacktheweather.github.io/\n\nHack the Weather will challenge teams of developers to use The Weather Company weather and forecast data and IBM data science tools to create a smart data application or model.\n\nPrizes:\n\n· Three finalist teams will be brought to Las Vegas, October 26-28, 2015 for Insight 2015!

Deploying Applications to the Cloud with Docker\n\nPresented by: Ryan Baxter, Developer Advocate - IBM Bluemix\n\nOur news feeds are full of stories talking about the failures and successes of companies that have moved applications to the cloud. Ultimately the consensus seems to be that moving applications to the cloud is a good thing, the next question is “how”? One solution that has taken the world by storm is Docker. While initially Docker seems promising, development and operations teams are often left with the problem of coming up with some type of Docker orchestration and management solution for deploying their applications. In this session we will get our hands dirty.\n\nWe are going to use IBM Bluemix to get your application to the cloud and leverage the power and portability of Docker containers. We’ll talk about everything from build pipelines, to private registries, to container monitoring. And we’ll assess Bluemix as an end-to-end cloud solution for deploying Docker.\n\nStill haven't registered for your free Bluemix account?

In Spark, the querying is done in-memory where real-time or archived data can provide faster time-to-value results. Spark was designed to provide from 10 to 100 times faster performance for specific applications. It complements Hadoop’s capabilities by providing a unified platform for storing and analyzing the data in a single environment.\n\nIt offers an integral view and opportunity to gain valuable insights by analyzing large volumes of structured and unstructured data. The main benefit is the capability to deliver these real-time insights based on a simplified software development process - creating and running algorithms to extract value from a wide range of data sets. Apache Spark is the platform for creating and running such algorithms.\n\nThis session is a technical discussion so all big data architects, developers, technical personnel, etc. are welcome to attend.\n\nPlease join us Wednesday, October[masked] for a virtual discussion (details to follow) of Apache Spark to learn more about this newer technology and the advantages gained when data scientists can build models quickly and run iterative jobs on distributed data sets. See how big Spark really is.","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Philadelphia/events/225534560/","yes_rsvp_count":80,"name":"Spark- Something Big","time":1444255200000,"updated":1444329750000,"status":"past","group_id":9505612,"group_name":"Big Data Developers in Philadelphia","lat":39.952583,"lon":-75.165222,"city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","country":"us","_id":"225534560"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1441842305000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"JUST A REMINDER THAT YOU MUST REGISTER AT THE URL BELOW IN ORDER TO CONFIRM YOUR SEAT AT THIS EVENT.\n\nJoin the Evolving Solutions technical team and experts from IBM for a Big Data hands-on workshop.

Examples would be something that measures (or even predicts) macro indicators like inflation, gdp, unemployment and manufacturing.\n\n2) Parse sentiment in financial news/social media text and/or video and image content on the web using Bluemix to create a sentiment based indicator that can measure and/or predict market direction.\n\n3) Analyze huge volumes of sec.gov data to perform real time fundamental analysis on companies using public filings using Watson. Insight should be useful in identifying undervalued stocks or short sale candidates. An offshoot project may involve scanning regulatory filings in real time and cross referencing options markets to create an indicator that could flag potential insider trading activity.\n\n4) Use Bluemix to create a polling tool that can be used to gather consensus opinion from alpha modus users about various topics like stock market direction, a stock's price or even a political election, a sporting event or new product release. Apply creativity in determining topics to poll. Then create an interactive real time visualization to display results of the poll.\n\nSuggested Bluemix APIs to Use:Alchemy APIConcept Expansion and InsightLanguage TranslationPersonality InsightsTrade Off AnalysisDataWorksInsights for TwitterPredictive AnalyticsStream AnalyticsData CacheSession cacheGeoCoding\n\nWrite your app in Node.js, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, Go or bring your own runtime.

The second talk will be held by Matthias J. Sax of Humboldt University Berlin, who will dive deeper into the bowels of processing windows on data streams with Flink.\n\nPreliminary Schedule\n\n• 18.30 – Talk 1 (Robert): Stream &amp; Batch Processing with Apache Flink\n\n• 19.30 – Dinner Time &amp; socialising\n\n• 20.30 – Talk 2 (Matthias): Feeding a Squirrel in Time -- Windows in Apache Flink\n\nAs always, this Meetup is free for all attendees &amp; Food and Beverages are provided by our host Inovex GmbH\n\nAbstracts\n\nStream &amp; Batch Processing with Apache Flink\n\nApache Flink is an open-source framework for distributed data analysis. Flink is one of the most active big data projects in the Apache Software Foundation and has more than 100 contributors. The core of Flink is a distributed stream processing engine that enables low-latency and high throughput data processing. Flink has high-level APIs for both stream and batch processing.In the first part of this talk we will briefly look at the history of Flink and then present the APIs and different use cases. Here we will also see how it can be deployed in practice.In the second part, we will look at the streaming execution engine that powers Flink. Here we will see what makes it tick and also what distinguishes it from other approaches, such as the mini-batch execution model. We will cover Flink's architecture and design decisions that result in Flink's unique set of features.\n\nFeeding a Squirrel in Time -- Windows in Apache Flink\n\nIn data stream processing, the dimension of time is a crucial aspect with regard to runtime effects as well as query semantics. There are two different time concepts: event-time also called occurrence time, ie, the time in which an event happens in the real world, and processing-time, ie, the time in which an events gets processed by the system. Both time dimensions deliver different semantics if used to specify windows on a data stream.In this talk, we give an introduction to time-base data streamprocessing and cover Flink's approach to handle windowing. Flink offers a broad range of (non-/)deterministic count-, time-, and custom-windows while offering a simple API to express those.\n\nPlease note that this event has also been posted here: http://www.meetup.com/inovex-munich/events/226206381/\n\nWe would like to thank our host Inovex GmbH for providing the location, food and drinks.","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Munich/events/226576873/","yes_rsvp_count":40,"name":"Stream & Batch Processing with Apache Flink and Event-Time Windowing","time":1447263000000,"updated":1447278875000,"status":"past","group_id":14476282,"group_name":"Big Data Developers in Munich","lat":48.13539,"lon":11.663948,"city":"München","country":"de","_id":"226576873"},{"utc_offset":0,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444131958000,"rating":{"count":4,"average":4.75},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Overview\n\nWelcome to our first meetup.\n\nAs it is our first meetup it's only polite that we have a quick 101 on what POWER and OpenPOWER are.

PrepFlash can help by automatically generating study/test questions from most any digital content (pdf, ppt, websites, ebooks, even photos). PrepFlash has turned IBM Watson into a virtual tutor. Rather than answering questions, PrepFlash asks you questions. Learn about the potential for IBM Watson and cognitive computing in educational applications. PrepFlash leverages key IBM technologies such as AlchemyAPI, SoftLayer, and StrongLoop to develop \"Rapid eLearning\" content for corporate training, online education companies, and students. PrepFlash’s key challenge was to create real-time multiple-choice assessment exams and fill-in-the-blank study aids (similar to human authors) from multiple content sources (PDF files, webpages, Youtube videos, wiki pages). Come see health and energy corporate training case studies and how PrepFlash leverages IBM Watson to change the world of training and education.\n\nAgenda: 6:00 pm - Networking, food, and drinks\n\n6:30 pm - Session start\n\n7:45 pm - Wrap-up and more networking\n\nJohn Hanks is Founder of PrepFlash and has created more than 100 education mobile apps for continuing education and health certifications.

Developers can now create smarter applications using a subset of these cognitive computing capabilities through services from Watson, reasoning on a corpus, and suggestion an answer that is “best” rather than “right”.\n\n+ Agenda :\n\n- 09:00am - 10:30 am : Overview of Bluemix Fundamentals – Architecture, Services and Examples\n\n- 10:30am - 12:00 pm : Overview of Watson Developer Cloud\n\n- 01:00pm – 02:30 pm : Lab Session 1: “Create and deploy a simple web/mobile application” using Bluemix.\n\n- 02:30pm – 04:00 pm : Lab Session 2: “Create and deploy a simple cognitive application” using Bluemix Watson services\n\n+ Instructor : Mr. Justin Lee (Evangelist from Asean IBM)","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Viet-Nam-Meetup-IBM-Cloud/events/226880442/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":27000000,"name":"Hybrid Cloud Training Workshop","time":1447984800000,"updated":1448013235000,"status":"past","group_id":18595024,"group_name":"IBM Cloud Vietnam - Together We Change The World","lat":21.025379,"lon":105.843399,"city":"Hanoi","country":"vn","_id":"226880442"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447946740000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"I'll be at the Frontier again tomorrow - probably last time for the year.

If you have large amounts of data that requires low latency processing that a typical Map Reduce program cannot provide, Spark is the alternative.\n\nSpark performs at speeds up to 100 times faster than Map Reduce for iterative algorithms or interactive data mining. Spark provides in-memory cluster computing for lightning fast speed and supports Java, Scala, and Python APIs for ease of development. Spark allows data scientists to build models quickly and supports iterative jobs on distributed datasets. This means more people can apply deep intelligence into applications to make everything smarter, including the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, web, mobile, social, business process and more.\n\nDo you believe in the value of Spark, in the speed, efficiency and flexibility of this in-memory compute engine? IBM does. Emphatically. That's why we're committed to do everything we can to accelerate the adoption of Spark for enterprise analytics, where Spark promises seemingly unlimited value.\n\nOn June 15, 2015, IBM hosted a Spark Community event in San Francisco, California: IBM | Spark - The Start of Something Big in Data and Design.

SAMEntics thus provides an intelligent alternative to handling large volumes of text efficiently by not only automatically creating clusters based off user intent in a hierarchical manner but also generating rewordings of user queries in the case of sparse and(or) poor quality partner data.PhrazIt on the other hand provides an essence extraction tool that helps establish thematic relevance to text and is aimed at rendering the most thematically relevant sentences from the partner TREC files . PhrazIt thus renders the most relevant sentences from passages of text and if plugged into JumpQA (a question generation tool) could also be utilized for enhancing partner ground truth.Requirements for the talk :Some familiarity with machine learning algorithmic paradigms, basic understanding of tasks in natural language processing, some awareness of concepts like distributed semantic space, ensemble classifiers and graph based ranking.Bonus section :\"What's hot in data science\".

He is one of the top committers in the open source community of Tachyon project. Prior to Tachyon Nexus, he worked in Google to build the next-generation storage infrastructure and won Google's Technical Infrastructure award. Bin had publication in most prestigious acadmic conferences in Computer Science including SIGCOMM, SOSP, NSDI, and got his PhD in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University\nTitle: Introduction to Memory-centric Distributed Storage System Tachyon and Its Use Case\nAbstract:Memory is the key to fast Big Data processing. This has been realized by many, and frameworks such as Spark and Shark already leverage memory performance. As data sets continue to grow, storage is increasingly becoming a critical bottleneck in many workloads.\nTo address this need, we have developed Tachyon, a memory centric fault-tolerant distributed file system, which enables reliable file sharing at memory-speed across cluster frameworks, such as Spark and MapReduce. Tachyon caches working set files in memory, and enables different jobs/queries and frameworks to access cached files at memory speed. Different from traditional replication scheme, Tachyon achieves fault-tolerance by leveraging lineage information.\nOver two years of research and production deployment, Tachyon as an open-source system has more than 160 contributors from over 50 institutions, including IBM, Yahoo, Intel, Redhat, Baidu, and Tachyon Nexus. We had a major release, version 0.8 in October 2015, including numerous new features. In particular, the latest version support mounting of multiple under storage systems and transparent naming enables more exciting use cases for Tachyon users, remote write to allow users to write to Tachyon through remote workers, detailed monitoring of the master and workers, and integration with Yarn and Mesos. In the presentation, we will also explore several potential industry use cases enabled by the new features.\n=============\nSpeaker: Kostas Sakellis is a Software Engineer and contributor to Apache Spark. Previous to that, he contributed to the extensibility effort on Cloudera Manager. Before Cloudera, Kostas did a 6 year stint at Amazon working across various teams including platform infrastructure. Kostas has a Bachelors of Mathematics in Computer Science from the University of Waterloo.\nTitle: Apache Spark 101: Taming Big Data\nAbstract:Apache Spark has become a very popular data processing framework due to its speed and easy of use. In this talk we will start at the beginning and give a brief technical introduction to key Spark concepts and differentiators. We will dive deep into the core architecture of Spark and discuss improvements over MapReduce. We will conclude with a few examples of Spark being used to solve real world problems.\n=============","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Singapore/events/226995364/","yes_rsvp_count":71,"name":"December Meetup during Strata!","time":1448965800000,"updated":1448984089000,"status":"past","group_id":12764782,"group_name":"Big Data Developers in Singapore","lat":1.352083,"lon":103.819839,"city":"Suntec City","country":"sg","_id":"226995364"},{"utc_offset":3600000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","created":1447242664000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"IBM Smart Big Data Days - Obtain Insight and Agility using IBM’s Big Data Platform\n\nPLEASE ENROLL HERE because number of attendants is limited\n\nhttp://www-304.ibm.com/events/idr/idrevents/detail.action?meid=10980&amp;ieid=14508&amp;from=find\n\nDescription\n\nBigData represents a new and fast growing era in data exploration and utilization.

Cognitive computing is enabling us to open up an enormous body of information to computing that previously was \"dark\" to computers; information such as text literature, audio and video that previously could not be truly understood by the computer; information whose real intent could only be understood by other human beings; what we might otherwise think of as being the world of experiences that we, as human beings, share and understand that computers could not do much to help us with. In this talk, we will discuss how IBM Watson has broken through these barriers to enable a whole new generation of applications that solve business and social problems by leverage the world of human expression; that create benefits in areas of decision support and inspiration that previously has not been possible.\n\nTopics:- Applications of cognitive in healthcare, commerce...etc.- Cognitive systems architecture and IBM Watson- Get started with cognitive using the IBM Watson developer cloud\n\nBio:Rob High is an IBM Fellow, Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, Watson Group.

Brett Rudenstein, Director of Product Management, Big Data, Wandisco\n\n• Deploying Big Data in the Insurance Industry. David Skrivanek – Big Data expert from a leading insurance company\n\n• Big SQL - Making all of your big data SQL accessible using an optimal execution strategy. Presenters: Michael Harkins, Virender Thakur, IBM\n\nContinuous Data Management for Hadoop and Spark – On-Premise or in the Cloud\n\nKEYNOTE SPEAKER:\n\nBrett Rudenstein, Director of Product Management, Big Data, Wandisco\n\nBrett Rudenstein has an extensive background in Application Lifecycle Management, High Performance Computing and Open Source Software Analysis. He has held senior sales engineering and management positions at Rational Software, PureAtria, IBM, Appistry and Palamida. Throughout his career, he has enabled organizations to accelerate technology adoption by understanding their needs and providing just-in-time business solutions. As WANdisco Director of Product Management for Big Data, Brett works with partners, prospects, and customers to help them understand and evolve the requirements for enterprise-ready Hadoop.\n\n----------------\n\nBig Data makes it possible to inexpensively store and process petabytes of structured, unstructured and semi-structured data generated at incredible speeds. However, the ultimate benefits of big data are lost if fresh, fast-moving data is not analyzed as it happens. Fast data is about data in motion—immediate response and action.\n\nThe collection process for data in motion is essentially the same as data at rest, but the key difference is the analysis occurs in real time as data is generated and captured. However, this analysis has to include the historical context provided by data at rest in order to be meaningful. This requires an enterprise-ready architecture that efficiently handles both data at rest and data in motion with the following components:\n\n- An enterprise grade Big Data platform to support real-time analytics applications without downtime or data loss - A flexible and agile cloud environment for cost-effective burst-out processing - A data migration/replication engine that exceeds the most demanding application SLAs.\n\nThis meet up will provide an overview of the “best in class” architecture required to harness the benefits of Big Data with “Continuous Data Management for Hadoop and Spark”\n\nBig SQL 4.1. Presenters:\n\nMichael Harkins, Virender Thakur, IBM\n\nBig SQL provides ANSI SQL access to data across any system from Hadoop, via JDBC or ODBC - seamlessly whether that data exists in Hadoop or a relational data base. This means that developers familiar with the SQL programming language can access data in Hadoop without having to learn new languages or skills. Big SQL sets a new bar: performance. Benchmark tests indicate that Big SQL executes queries 20 times faster, on average, over Apache Hive 12 with performance improvements ranging up to 70 times faster. It can query and combine data from many data sources, including (but not limited to) DB2 for Linux, Teradata, Oracle, UNIX and Windows database software, IBM PureData System for Analytics.\n\nWith Big SQL, all of your big data is SQL accessible.

After a brief introduction on the nature of distributed systems (from distributed databases, through distributed state, to distributed computation), you will learn how to use Akka Cluster and Akka Persistence to implement such distributed systems. Once the data is safely stored in a journal, it is important to be able to perform deeper analysis. To do so, Jan will show you how to access the data in the journal in a distributed computation program running in Apache Spark.\n\nWith the mechanics done, Jan will explain how to use (deep) neural networks that can be very easily trained to recognize patterns in the ingested data.\n\nYou will learn the advantages and traps of designing distributed domains, data and computation: systems that may become the next generation of financial systems, bringing elasticity, resilience and responsiveness. You will look in particular at systems that consume data from IoT / wearables, and that perform immediate and batch analyses.\n\nRegistration from 6pm, talks begin at 6:30pm.

As part of this work, we have developed open-source tools in a variety of languages. One of this tools, Innkeeper, is a simple, RESTful route management API built on top of reactive technologies like Akka HTTP and Slick. It will help our fleet of router instances to keep their routes in sync.\n\nIn this presentation, I'll discuss Innkeeper’s architecture and how — by choosing a reactive stack of technologies — we can stream database records back to the browser. I’ll talk about how (and why) we secured our API using OAuth, and give insights on how we use Docker and the STUPS tools to auto-scale this API on top of AWS. Finally, I’ll describe how we designed a set of unit and integration tests to make sure that our application works correctly, and how we set up our continuous integration environment.\n\nAbout the speaker: Dan Persa has been a software engineer at Zalando since 2013 and is a member of the Fashion Store team, which is responsible for Zalando’s core ecommerce business. He loves Java and Scala and more recently has been exploring Go and Node.js. He’s a big fan of clean code and software craftsmanship. In addition to coding, he enjoys mentoring new developers, organizing coder dojos and reading groups and giving tech talks. In his free time he likes to take photos and dance salsa.\n\nDiscussion 2\n\nTitle: Cloud Scale Machine Learning with ApacheSpark, MLLIB, Cloudfoundry and OpenStack Swift\n\nSpeaker: Romeo Kienzler - Chief Data Scientist - IBM Cloud Transformation Lab Zurich\n\nAbstract: Clouds provide very cost effective access to computing power and storage. Especially on workloads with high variation on computational and storage resource requirements. Resilient data processing engines like Apache Spark, a parallel machine learning library on top like MLLIB and elastic storage services like OpenStack Swift are a perfect fit to build a Resilient data processing framework.

Presenters:Rick Tarro, Jeffrey Carlson - IBM Analytics\n\nBig Data makes it possible to inexpensively store and process petabytes of structured, unstructured and semi-structured data generated at incredible speeds. However, the ultimate benefits of big data are lost if fresh, fast-moving data is not analyzed as it happens. Fast data is about data in motion—immediate response and action.\n\nThe collection process for data in motion is essentially the same as data at rest, but the key difference is the analysis occurs in real time as data is generated and captured. However, this analysis has to include the historical context provided by data at rest in order to be meaningful. This requires an enterprise-ready architecture that efficiently handles both data at rest and data in motion with the following components:\n\n- An enterprise grade Big Data platform to support real-time analytics applications without downtime or data loss - A flexible and agile cloud environment for cost-effective burst-out processing - A data migration/replication engine that exceeds the most demanding application SLAs.\n\nThis meet up will provide an overview of the “best in class” architecture required to harness the benefits of Big Data with “Continuous Data Management for Hadoop and Spark”\n\nBig SQL provides ANSI SQL access to data across any system from Hadoop, via JDBC or ODBC - seamlessly whether that data exists in Hadoop or a relational data base. This means that developers familiar with the SQL programming language can access data in Hadoop without having to learn new languages or skills. Big SQL sets a new bar: performance. Benchmark tests indicate that Big SQL executes queries 20 times faster, on average, over Apache Hive 12 with performance improvements ranging up to 70 times faster. It can query and combine data from many data sources, including (but not limited to) DB2 for Linux, Teradata, Oracle, UNIX and Windows database software, IBM PureData System for Analytics.\n\nWith Big SQL, all of your big data is SQL accessible. It presents a structured view of your existing data, using an optimal execution strategy, given your available resources.\n\nParking Information:Revere Hotel at 200 Stuart Street - $10 for 3 hoursThe outdoor Laz parking lot across the street, behind Smith &amp; Wollensky - $7 ($5 off)","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Boston/events/226909204/","yes_rsvp_count":145,"duration":10800000,"name":"Continuous Data Management for Hadoop and Spark – On-Premise or in the Cloud","time":1452637800000,"updated":1452650315000,"status":"past","group_id":9505222,"group_name":"Big Data Developers in Boston","lat":42.349983,"lon":-71.069504,"city":"Boston","state":"MA","country":"us","_id":"226909204"},{"utc_offset":3600000,"headcount":41,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447839481000,"rating":{"count":6,"average":4.670000076293945},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"DB/2 has changed over the years.

Traditionally, this process has required extensive, human-driven development of web crawlers and scrapers, but as we continue to innovate, we're using machine learning to automate more and more extraction. For this talk, we'll provide a quick intro into our crawling and database architecture and then follow up with how we're using machine learning to dramatically scale our operations.\n\nPrerequisites / Level: The talk will range from beginner to intermediate topics. Exposure to web crawling and machine learning will help, but is not required.\n\nMeet the Speaker: Shion Deysarkar is the CEO &amp; founder of Datafiniti.\n\nThanks to Sponsors: Special thanks to IBM for sponsoring food and drink for the evening and thanks to Datafiniti for hosting. Please note, this event is limited to the first 85 people who show up.\n\n*Note, expedite check in and register here in advance.","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Austin/events/227743235/","yes_rsvp_count":24,"name":"2 Great Machine Learning Talks","time":1452729600000,"updated":1452741554000,"status":"past","group_id":5570792,"group_name":"Big Data Developers in Austin","lat":30.272921,"lon":-97.744385,"city":"Austin","state":"TX","country":"us","_id":"227743235"},{"utc_offset":32400000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","created":1451145414000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"• 일시 및 장소- 일시 : 2016년 1월 14일 목요일 12:30 - 17:00- 장소 :선릉 D.Camp 6층 다목적홀\n\n• 참석 등록 웹사이트:http://www.meetup.com/Bluemix-Seoul-PaaS-and-Cloud-Computing-Meetup/\n\nBluemix Meetup 페이지에서 사전등록을 하여 주시기 바랍니다.\n\n사전 등록시, Meetup 쪽지나 메일로 '성함/연락처/회사명/부서명/직급'을 보내 주시거나 등록 시 꼭 표기하여 주시기 바랍니다.\n\n참석자분들에게 공지사항이나 기타의 내용이 있을 때, 누락되시지 않도록 사전등록하시면서 반드시 '성함/연락처/회사명/부서명/직급'을 저에게 보내 주시기 바랍니다. 정보 전달주신 분들에 한해서 사전 등록이 완료되십니다.\n\n-담당자: 임지현 과장/[masked]\n\n-참석자: 성함/회사명/부서명/직급/연락처(이메일,전화번호)\n\n[준비물]\n\n실습 노트북을 지참하여 주시기 바랍니다.\n\n[IBM Bluemix Meetup 이란?]\n\nIBM에서 Bluemix 7번째 MeetUp을 시작합니다.\n\n2016년 힘차게 시작하는「붉은 원숭이 해」1월.

In some cases, even longer. The Cloud Foundry Foundation offers a unique approach to gaining committer in as little as six weeks, which we call the Cloud Foundry Dojo. The program is derived from the Pivotal labs Dojo program. It allows developers to master Cloud Foundry by working shoulder to shoulder on the open-source project with other Cloud Foundry engineers. Qualified engineers from the Cloud Foundry community can participate in pair programming with committers on a Cloud Foundry project team, gain invaluable experience with the core technology and the unique agile development environment, and make direct contributions to the codebase. Participation typically lasts 6-12 weeks.\n\n· Become part of the EMC Cloud Foundry Technical Community\n\n· Learn DevOps practices and culture\n\n· Accelerate your knowledge of the Cloud Foundry platform\n\n· Develop relationships with all the key contributors\n\n· Lead the next wave of innovation\n\nEMC's Cambridge-based Dojo will host software developers from EMC customers and partners, along with developers from EMC's own software engineering ranks. The facility itself is designed as an open shared environment that is purpose-built for software developers to write code together through the agile pair programming/TDD model. The facility will also host regular Meetups with the local Cloud Foundry community.\n\nPlease RSVP by Signing up for the Meetup","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Area-Cloud-Foundry-Meetup/events/227918919/","yes_rsvp_count":63,"duration":7200000,"name":"EMC Cambridge Dojo Opening Ceremony","time":1453489200000,"updated":1453578088000,"status":"past","group_id":10702282,"group_name":"The Boston Area Cloud Foundry Meetup","lat":42.364799,"lon":-71.088791,"city":"Cambridge","state":"MA","country":"us","_id":"227918919"},{"utc_offset":28800000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452830512000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Calling all CEOs and CTOs of Startups, ISVs and SIs - come experienc the power and values of IBM Bluemix.

Josh is very interested in Artificial Intelligence and how it can/will improve the interaction between human and computers.\n\nCognitive IoT: Making the Internet of Things Deliver for All of Us\n\nThe early visionaries of the Internet of Things, IBM’s thought leaders among them, foresaw a time when practically any physical object could be equipped with sensors and hooked up to the Internet to translate the physical world into digital information.They were focusing on factory assembly lines, electrical grids, automobiles, highways, buildings, and the like. The goal was to gather streams of information from sensors that could be used to automate processes such as balancing supply and demand in a power grid and operate more efficiently.Today, these applications have become mainstream, so it’s time to take advantage of a second generation of Internet of Things technologies and capabilities something we at IBM call the Cognitive Internet of Things.Cognitive IoT technologies will make it possible for business leaders to understand what’s happening in the world more deeply. By infusing intelligence into systems and processes, businesses will be able to not only do things more efficiently, but to improve customer satisfaction, to discover new business opportunities, and to anticipate risks and threats so they can better deal with them.As powerful as today’s sensor networks are, they aren’t up to the task of unlocking the complex interrelationships between people, places and things that drive business and the economy. To reach the next level, businesses need cognitive technologies that enable them to gather and integrate data from many types of sensors and other sources, to reason over that data, and to learn from their interactions with it.\n\n#IBMWatson","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/IBM-Watson-and-Cognitive-Computing/events/227441913/","yes_rsvp_count":257,"duration":7200000,"name":"IBM Watson + Robots = Cognitive IoT ","time":1453777200000,"updated":1453829448000,"status":"past","group_id":12742492,"group_name":"IBM Watson and Cognitive Computing","_id":"227441913"},{"utc_offset":28800000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452830364000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Calling developers - come experienc the power and values of IBM Bluemix.

He's also the co-author of O'Reilly's Cloud Native Java. Kenny engages a community of passionate developers on topics ranging from graph databases to microservices.\n\nKenny Bastani will be talking to us about Spring Cloud, a set of tools for building cloud-native JVM applications. We will take a look at some of the common patterns for microservice architectures and how to use Cloud Foundry to deploy multiple microservices to the cloud.\n\nWe will also dive into a microservices example project of a cloud-native application built using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud. Using this example project, Kenny will show you how to use Cloud Foundry to spin up a microservice cluster. We will then explore what a cloud-native application looks like when using self-describing REST APIs that link multiple microservices together.\n\nAgenda :\n\n6:30 - 7 pm - Food and Networking\n\n7.00 - 8:00 pm - Event\n\n8:00 - 9 pm - Closing Remarks and Networking","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/nyc-cloud-foundry/events/228459887/","yes_rsvp_count":53,"name":"Joint Meetup with Cloud Native New York on how to build and deploy microservices","time":1454542200000,"updated":1454569862000,"status":"past","group_id":11153092,"group_name":"New York City Cloud Foundry Meetup","lat":40.740337,"lon":-73.995186,"city":"New York","state":"NY","country":"us","_id":"228459887"},{"utc_offset":3600000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","created":1453896828000,"rating":{"count":4,"average":4.5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Agenda del Meetup:\n\n• Introduction to Spark Technology Center: http://www.spark.tc/\n\n( John Gairhan, World Wide Leader Big Data at IBM)\n\n• Qué es Spark y cómo lo utilizamos a diario.\n\n( Juantomás García Molina, Director Big Data Division en ASPgems)\n\n• Ejecutando Spark as a service\n\n( Arancha Ocaña, CTP Big Data en IBM)\n\n• Pizzas y Cervezas (para ser un meetup que se precie...)\n\nFecha: 4/2/2015\n\nUbicación: Ubicación: Client Center IBM\n\nCorazón de María 44, 28002 Madrid\n\nEmpezaremos a las 17:00 y durará hasta las 19:30 aprox","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-in-Madrid/events/228397026/","yes_rsvp_count":130,"duration":9000000,"name":"Spark","time":1454601600000,"updated":1454962480000,"status":"past","group_id":7770922,"group_name":"Big Data Developers in Madrid","lat":40.444145,"lon":-3.667261,"city":"Madrid","country":"es","_id":"228397026"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":51,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1453847484000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Cloud Foundry is currently the most powerful and most popular Platform as a Service (PaaS) in the world.

This data, generated by mobile devices, apps, sensors and wearable tech represents highly valuable information. Making accurate, real-time decisions with raw data to unlock its economic potential is now becoming crucial for countless businesses. Many organizations are still struggling to find out how to leverage the promise of big data.\n\nIn this session you will:\n\nexplore the technological challenges of big datafind the right infrastructure for your big data workloadsdiscover how to overcome the common pitfalls when using Cloud and NoSQL databases\n\nMining raw data can be gold to your business. Find out how you can exploit its value.\n\nThe session with IBM SoftLayer: John Easton, IBM Distinguished Engineer and Lead Cloud Advisor UKI and Nordics, will be the voice of IBM Cloud SoftLayer and his talk will cover:\n\nWe find ourselves in a data-rich world; having easy access to data from a multitude of different sources. Only a few years ago, very few companies could do this. Now everyone has the potential to exploit data from sources as varied as weather, sensor, social etc. Organisations relying on traditional data processing techniques will be unable to keep up, let alone take advantage of the new opportunities this opens up. A new approach is needed: one based around cloud and cognitive techniques. This session will use a variety of real client examples to show the art of the possible. To demonstrate how organisations bring these different data sources together and apply innovative analytical approaches using cloud platforms optimised for these problems to disrupt industries and create new business value.\n\nJohn Easton will give you his insights on the following: examples of IoT application in real world, from premature infants treatment, to energy and utilities industry (bridging the Weather Company story Manu from Basho will use), to transport why and what type of compute and network infrastructure is critical for those type of workloads, showcasing the readiness and the uniqueness of IBM Cloud SoftLayer with single tenant environment and robust low latency network NodeRED from Bluemix, that provides a browser-based flow editor that makes it easy to wire together devices, APIs, and online services by using the wide range of nodes in the palette cognitive computing with Watson awe-inspiring videos presenting application of all the presented technologies in production\n\nThe session with IBM Innovation: IBM Innovation will be joining this talk with a session on “IoT Sensor outlier detection in the cloud using dashDB and R”\n\nRomeo Kienzler, Data Scientist at IBM InnovationCenter will explore how to create predictive models for real-time IoT data analysis:\n\n'IoT mainly is seen as distributed data generation. In order to create valuable insights this data has to be stored for retrospective analysis to create predictive models for real-time analysis. In this talk we show how to stream mqtt data acquired through subscription to IoT sensors into a distributed relational database and how the IBM R accelerator is used to push down R code to SQL and stored procedures to react in real-time to changing sensor data'","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Developers-Switzerland/events/228345778/","yes_rsvp_count":38,"name":"Strategy & Tech Talk - From meters to pacemakers - the Internet of Things","time":1455210000000,"updated":1455224440000,"status":"past","group_id":10220112,"group_name":"Big Data Developers in Switzerland","_id":"228345778"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1454518029000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Ever wanted to have your app make calls, send text messages, to better engage your users?

This brings with it a new set of functional and technical challenges to overcome - how do these \"tiny apps\" communicate? How do they discover each other? How big is too big? In this talk, we will build a microservice-based architecture up from scratch, while discussing different design patterns and common pitfalls, all in Node.js.\n\nBio: Jonathan Kaufman is a Developer Advocate for IBM Emerging Technology currently residing in Cambridge, MA. After getting a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Cornell University, he worked on all things front-end for IBM Verse. When not blogging about why React is his favorite framework, or how to do build awesome apps with IBM Bluemix and Watson, he can be found working on the intersection between music and technology.\n\nStill haven't registered for your free Bluemix account?

So come to the Mad Scientists event at IBM Southbank for a rather special evening where IBM developers, members of the LJC and University researchers will be demonstrating a whole range of the latest software and tech. You’ll hear about personal projects, creations approach, the problems solved, the tech people have used. The flavour of the event will be more Tech Fair than conference or presentation, with a sharing of ideas and technologies.\n\nAmongst a wide range of talks and demonstrations we’ll be hearing from:\n\nDave Snowdon: Getting emotional about robots and clojure\n\nSocial robots have become a regular feature of tech news over the last couple of years. Whether it's talk about Dr Cynthia Breazeal's Jibo robot, Aldebaran's Pepper robot working as a shop assistant in Japan &amp; France or yet another robot platform being crowdfunded on indiegogo. But why should we care? Is a \"siri on wheels\" any better than a siri in the hand? Why would we want social robots to be emotional? This talk will skirt around some of these questions, deftly avoid mention of SkyNet and somehow show that clojure is the answer.\n\nBio: By day, a mild-mannered programmer working on Virtual Desktop Infrastructure at VMware. By night, when not asleep, plans world domination by social emotional robots powered by python and clojure. Before he was virtualised Dave worked for Xerox Research in France and, back in the mists of time, developed one of the first distributed multi-user virtual reality environments as part of his PhD work at Manchester.\n\nHolly Cummins (Talk title to be confirmed)\n\nWe are delighted to be able to include Holly Cummins in our speaker line up. Holly is well known to members of the LJC (her most recent talk to the community was Confessions of an Automation Addict) and she’s a leader in innovative technology. She is technical lead in IBM's Bluemix Garage London, and a committer on the Apache Aries project. She is a co-author of Enterprise OSGi in Action and has spoken at Devoxx, JavaZone, The ServerSide Java Symposium, JAX London, GeeCon, and the Great Indian Developer Summit, as well as a number of user groups.\n\nLaura Cowen : Ambient Kettle Project\n\nWhenever I boil my kettle to have a cup of tea in Hampshire my Mum, in Lancashire, gets a tweet. Sometimes Mum replies to that tweet to say that she's having a cup of tea too. It's the closest we can get to having a cup of tea together most of the time. It's this sense of 'ambient connectedness' that we tried to develop with the Ambient Kettle project. I'll talk through how it works and then how we tried to capture the essential aspects of boiling a kettle and making a cup of tea to create a physical representation of my kettle.\n\nBio: Laura is a developer advocate at IBM where she’s building the WASdev developer community around the Liberty Java application server. She previously worked in UX and technical writing during her 13 years at IBM. She gets involved in cool IoT projects for fun. Laura has a BSc in Psychology and a Masters in Human-Computer Interaction. She’s currently studying for a PhD in Psychology. She also presents on the Ubuntu Podcast on open source and technology, and has organised and volunteered at open source community conferences like OggCamp.\n\nAgenda:\n\nDoors open at 6:00 pm with talks and demonstrations until around 9:00 pm.\n\nVenue:\n\nBoyle, Darwin &amp; Fleming rooms, IBM Client Centre, 76/78 Upper Ground, South Bank, London SE1 9PZ\n\nhttp://www-05.ibm.com/uk/locations/sbnk.html\n\nDrinks and pizza will be available thanks to our sponsors, IBM.\n\nRSVP early to secure your place!","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/London-PaaS-Bluemix-Meetup/events/229340728/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"duration":10800000,"name":"Mad Scientists","time":1458842400000,"updated":1458853873000,"status":"past","group_id":14354522,"group_name":"London PaaS & Bluemix Meetup","lat":51.506952,"lon":-0.111438,"city":"London","country":"gb","_id":"229340728"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1458136906000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"RSVPing to this meetup is not enough to attend.

This is a fantastic opportunity to hear some great speakers on developing applications using APIs in these fast-growing technologies. See below to register. Here is a description:\n\n***********************************************************\n\nMicroservice architectures have emerged as the preferred way to engineer robust, scalable cloud-native solutions. They encapsulate application logic in small, loosely-coupled, distributed services communicating via language-agnostic APIs. Despite their benefit, microservice-based solutions remain difficult to build using mainstream cloud technologies, often requiring control of a complex toolchain, and separate build and operations pipelines. At this meetup, we will share our experiences and practices that work for us and have been incorporated into our methodology. We'll show you our open toolchain platform that allows developers to define and standardize their DevOps toolchains, by selecting, integrating, configuring and organizing the best of open, third-party and IBM technologies to deliver innovative applications using a DevOps methodology. And we'll show you examples of how we're doing this in the context of Apache Spark, an open source cluster computing framework optimized for extremely fast and large scale data processing, and our Watson cognitive APIs - services for adding natural language and machine learning processing to your applications.\n\n***********************************************************\n\nWe will do IoT next meetup, but don't miss this opportunity to get some in-depth technical insight!\n\nPlease use the LINK here to register for this event.","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Bluemix-Washington-DC-PaaS-and-Cloud-Computing-Meetup/events/228258853/","yes_rsvp_count":40,"duration":10800000,"name":"Spark and Cognitive Analytics","time":1459461600000,"updated":1459473363000,"status":"past","group_id":19147905,"group_name":"Bluemix - Washington, DC PaaS and Cloud Computing Meetup","lat":38.927788,"lon":-77.236885,"city":"McLean","state":"VA","country":"us","_id":"228258853"},{"utc_offset":28800000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1400563937000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Tesla, BMW i8, they are very modern &amp; fashion to cars, not only a new car, also a revolution for automotive industry.\n\nBut, there is a big gap to such electronic cars, \"power provider\".\n\nLet's image, if those electronic cars can't get power as easy as fuel now for traditional cars, the revolution couldn't go further.\n\nIt will must be happened in the near future.

There is an IBM-provided Swift Sandbox for a sample of Swift running on the cloud.\n\nCome join this session for a “Hello World” with Swift on server and for plans about what is next for Swift @ IBM.","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Bluemix-Developers-in-Cambridge/events/229786479/","yes_rsvp_count":19,"name":"Swift Meetup","time":1460586600000,"updated":1458656994000,"status":"upcoming","group_id":13926432,"group_name":"Bluemix-Developers-in-Cambridge","lat":42.380001,"lon":-71.129997,"city":"Cambridge","state":"MA","country":"us","_id":"229786479"},{"utc_offset":7200000,"visibility":"public_limited","waitlist_count":0,"name":"Kickoff Opptys for IBM","time":1460635200000,"yes_rsvp_count":1,"group_id":19578882,"group_name":"Opptys for IBM","_id":"228943173"},{"utc_offset":7200000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455700071000,"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"We only scratched the surface at the last meetup.

What if we could use image and text analytics to produce a cognitive radiologist assistant which could quickly filter and present essential diagnostically meaningful images to clinicians for decision support? Such machines are a layer above PACS and EHR management systems and will combine imaging data along with the rest of clinical patient data to provide a variety of new cognitive tasks such as holistic summaries of the patients’ conditions, coincidental diagnosis, automatic triage and second opinion, as well as statistical comparisons to similar patients. In this talk we will review the overall Medical Sieve project, discuss some specific image and text analytics, and give a brief demonstration of a web-based interface for clinical decision support.\n\nSpeaker BIO:David Beymer is a research staff member and a research manager of the multimodal systems group at the IBM Almaden Research Center in San Jose, California. At IBM, he is currently working on the Medical Sieve project, focusing on medical imaging techniques for anomaly detection and clinical decision support in the healthcare industry. He earned a Ph.D. in computer science from MIT in 1995, working on automated techniques for face recognition. Since completing his Ph.D., he has studied vehicle tracking, face tracking, person tracking, eye gaze tracking, and eye gaze analytics the University of California at Berkeley, SRI International, and IBM Research. Within the healthcare informatics team at IBM, he helped co-develop the AALIM clinical decision support system and Clinical Data Hub patient cohort search tool aimed at clinical researchers.

You will learn why Spark was developed to crunch through Big Data, what MapReduce is, and why Spark can beat the pants off of it in terms of performance and ease of use. You will learn how non-programmers can get started with Spark (warning: there is no escaping code, but you can do it, we promise), with a hands on lab exploring Spark and the Spark Machine Learning library.\n\nSpecifically, the lab will introduce the data science methodology cycle through the implementation of one specific analytic approach: text classification. Through concrete examples, you will use Apache Spark and its machine learning library to develop and train a Naeve Bayes classifier. During this lab, we will also use a Jupyter Notebook to interact with a Spark cluster and explore text data as well as access data from files, object storage and through SQL to learn when each method is useful.\n\nAgenda:\n\n12:00 to 01:00 pm - Registration and Lunch01:00 to 02:00 pm - Overview of Apache Spark02:00 to 05:00 pm - Hands-on Lab - Spark Machine Learning/Text Classifier\n\nTo confirm your seat, please register here: http://ibm.co/1MGVQ6b\n\nLunch will be provided.
