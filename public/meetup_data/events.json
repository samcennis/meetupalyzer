Ryan's background is in software engineering, so he is interested in all things code.\n\nDirections and parking info:\n\n- We are located at 1 Rogers Street Cambridge, MA which is a U shaped building positioned between Edwin H. Land Blvd and 1st Street. The auditorium is located off the lobby on the 1st floor. The sign on the front of the building states \"One Charles Park\" which can sometimes confuse guests.\n\n- Parking is located across the street at the Cambridgeside Galleria Mall located at 100 Cambridgeside Place. We can validate guest parking for a discounted rate (usually $3-11 depending on how long they are parked).\n\n- Here is a map that shows where the mall is in relation to the center. Once you park your cars, you will take the elevator/escalator to the first floor of the mall. You will walk towards the end of the mall where the Cheesecake Factory and California Pizza Kitchen are located. The center is in the building directly across the street. You will have to walk along the side of the building, until you reach Rogers Street. From there, you will turn right and the front doors are located directly ahead.","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Area-Cloud-Foundry-Meetup/events/175299132/","yes_rsvp_count":47,"duration":9000000,"name":"Selecting and operating a Platform as a Service","time":1400796000000,"updated":1400806272000,"status":"past","group_id":10702282,"group_name":"The Boston Area Cloud Foundry Meetup","lat":42.365738,"lon":-71.07682,"city":"Cambridge","state":"MA","country":"us","_id":"175299132"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1400887465000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Initial discussion and meet and greet.Pleas RSVP.\n\nThanks\n\nTuhin","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Revealed-Austin/events/184847332/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"name":"meet and greet","time":1401048000000,"updated":1401061860000,"status":"past","group_id":14364582,"group_name":"Big Data Revealed","_id":"184847332"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1390831658000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":4.5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"At this IBM-sponsored meet up, Daniel Krook and Ryan Baxter will demonstrate BlueMix, a new public Platform-as-a-Service offering based on Cloud Foundry.\n\nAfter the meeting, you'll have an opportunity to sign up for the BlueMix beta and kick the tires yourself!\n\nRefreshments will be provided by IBM at the meeting.\n\nAgenda\n\n6 - 6:30 PM - Refreshments and conversation6:30 - 7:30 - Introduction to BlueMix and demo7:30 - 8 - Post meeting conversation","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/nyc-cloud-foundry/events/162795972/","yes_rsvp_count":45,"name":"Introduction to IBM BlueMix (Powered by Cloud Foundry)","time":1401228000000,"updated":1401478528000,"status":"past","group_id":11153092,"group_name":"New York City Cloud Foundry Meetup","lat":40.762196,"lon":-73.972755,"city":"New York","state":"NY","country":"us","_id":"162795972"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1398454432000,"rating":{"count":3,"average":4.670000076293945},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Hello World!

No longer is that developer concerned with virtual machines, networks and storage, instead they are focused on and working with applications and the services they leverage.\n\nAfter a brief introduction to the platform, in this meetup we will take a multi-tier application that was originally built for deployment onto physical or virtual machines, necessitating the deployment of numerous prerequisite softwares, and we’ll deploy it to Cloud Foundry, which provides all of those prerequisites out of the box. Only minor changes were made to the application with major benefits. We’ll provision services (i.e. database and messaging instances), deploy applications, bind them to those services and start up the app. The session will be light on slides and heavy on live demo.\n\nThe Cloud Foundry PaaS is entirely open sourced, available on Github and can be deployed on any number of IaaS including vSphere, OpenStack and AWS, plus there is an option where you can even run it on your laptop. Pivotal also offers it in the cloud at run.pivotal.io. If you come with a run.pivotal.io account and with thecli installed you’ll even be able to follow along and have a working app by the end of the evening.\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nA self-proclaimed propeller head, Cornelia Davis works as a Platform Engineer in the Cloud Foundry group of Pivotal. Fundamentally responsible for making developers successful with the Cloud Foundry PaaS, you can generally find her knee deep in the (OSS) code base, writing apps and deploying them onto the PaaS, teaching at a whiteboard, presenting at conferences and passionately driving new features into the product.\n\nWhen not doing those things you can find her on the yoga mat or in the kitchen.","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/nyc-cloud-foundry/events/162796272/","yes_rsvp_count":68,"name":"Deploying a multi-tier application to Cloud Foundry","time":1403647200000,"updated":1403691061000,"status":"past","group_id":11153092,"group_name":"New York City Cloud Foundry Meetup","lat":40.74021,"lon":-73.994774,"city":"New York","state":"NY","country":"us","_id":"162796272"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1400476544000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":4},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"The IBM Rochester Technical Vitality Council invites you to attend a special hands on 1.5 hour Meetup on June 25, 2014 from 4:00 to 5:30 pm at IBM Rochester.

No longer is that developer concerned with virtual machines, networks and storage, instead they are focused on and working with applications and the services they leverage.\n\nAfter a brief introduction to the platform, in this meetup we will take a multi-tier application that was originally built for deployment onto physical or virtual machines, necessitating the deployment of numerous prerequisite softwares, and we’ll deploy it to Cloud Foundry, which provides all of those prerequisites out of the box. Only minor changes were made to the application with major benefits. We’ll provision services (i.e. database and messaging instances), deploy applications, bind them to those services and start up the app. The session will be light on slides and heavy on live demo.\n\nThe Cloud Foundry PaaS is entirely open sourced, available on Github and can be deployed on any number of IaaS including vSphere, OpenStack and AWS, plus there is an option where you can even run it on your laptop. Pivotal also offers it in the cloud at run.pivotal.io. If you come with a run.pivotal.io account and with the cli installed you’ll even be able to follow along and have a working app by the end of the evening.\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nA self-proclaimed propeller head, Cornelia Davis works as a Platform Engineer in the Cloud Foundry group of Pivotal. Fundamentally responsible for making developers successful with the Cloud Foundry PaaS, you can generally find her knee deep in the (OSS) code base, writing apps and deploying them onto the PaaS, teaching at a whiteboard, presenting at conferences and passionately driving new features into the product.\n\nWhen not doing those things you can find her on the yoga mat or in the kitchen.","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Area-Cloud-Foundry-Meetup/events/174778172/","yes_rsvp_count":25,"duration":9000000,"name":"Deploying a multi-tier application to Cloud Foundry","time":1403821800000,"updated":1403887258000,"status":"past","group_id":10702282,"group_name":"The Boston Area Cloud Foundry Meetup","lat":42.362896,"lon":-71.087486,"city":"Cambridge","state":"MA","country":"us","_id":"174778172"},{"utc_offset":28800000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1400563937000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Tesla, BMW i8, they are very modern &amp; fashion to cars, not only a new car, also a revolution for automotive industry.\n\nBut, there is a big gap to such electronic cars, \"power provider\".\n\nLet's image, if those electronic cars can't get power as easy as fuel now for traditional cars, the revolution couldn't go further.\n\nIt will must be happened in the near future.

Once again, we have access to Shoreditch Village Hall so we can return to this excellent venue for the September meetup.\n\nThe next meetup includes a talk by Cloudant on using this database with Bluemix, and a talk on the development environment that forms part of Bluemix (called IBM DevOps Services).\n\nMore details\n\nBuilding apps with Cloudant and BlueMix (Simon Metson)\n\nCloudant is a NoSQL database provided as a service (DBaaS). It's the perfect partner for data rich BlueMix applications; enabling you to easily store, analyse and search your data without the worry of scaling issues or the \"app store effect\". The talk will look at the \"aaS\" landscape, what you can do with Cloudant and how integrating Cloudant and BlueMix can really supercharge your applications.\n\nSimon Metson is the Product Director, Cloudant (anIBM® company). When asked to introduce himself, he said:\n\n\"I’m Simon Metson, a lapsed particle physicist, a product director at Cloudant (now an IBM® company), and a project committer on Apache CouchDB. For 10 years I worked on the distributed computing system for one of the Large Hadron Collider experiments, dealing with petabytes of relational and non-relational data.

Instead, IBM would like to make Bluemix available to as many technical developers as possible, free of charge. We would also like to provide an opportunity for technical developers in the Rochester area to collaborate and interact around this new service. There may be some time at the end to do some coding, so bring your laptop.

Capabilities include support for multiple programming languages and runtimes including Java and Node.js, mobile backend development, application monitoring, as well as capabilities from ecosystem partners and open source — all through an as-a-service model in the cloud. To find out more information, go to the Bluemix website at https://ace.ng.bluemix.net/.\n\nHopefully you will want to join us for this exciting opportunity to \"Meetup\" with technical IBMers and other technical people in Rochester.

Hybris is considered as a leader in the enterprise multichannel commerce and e-commerce market by industry analyst firms Forrester Research, Gartner and Ventana Research.\n\n[y]aaS is a multi tenant cloud platform which allows everyone to easily develop, extend and sell commerce services and apps. [y]aaS is based on a steadily growing micro service architecture running on Cloud Foundry as foundation. All services within [y]aaS are exposed through a consistent RESTfull API. Beside the API [y]aas also includes a Marketplace for hybris services as well as 3rd party service, an On Demand Store Front and a Back office application, all running on Cloud Foundry.\n\nIn this talk we will share our experience developing such an architecture and how Cloud Foundry helped us to streamline and speed up our development. We will also touch certain aspects of the infrastructure built up around Cloud Foundry and our Micro Services, like Logging and Monitoring.\n\nSpeaker\n\nRené WelchesProduct Owner – PaaS Cloud Foundry at hybrisRené started with hybris last year in the On Demand Delivery area. This year René took over the Cloud Foundry topic within hybris. He and his team are not only setting up a Cloud Foundry practice within hybris but also contributing to the SAP Cloud Foundry initiative. If he is not working with Cloud Foundry he plays Capoeira, bikes throughout New York or tries to catch some of the few waves at Long Beach.","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/nyc-cloud-foundry/events/214585402/","yes_rsvp_count":42,"name":"Commerce as a (Micro-) Service with Cloud Foundry","time":1416439800000,"updated":1416451320000,"status":"past","group_id":11153092,"group_name":"New York City Cloud Foundry Meetup","lat":40.74021,"lon":-73.994774,"city":"New York","state":"NY","country":"us","_id":"214585402"},{"utc_offset":28800000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1415763571000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Deliver Bluemix business and technical overview, demo and hands-on labs.","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/IIC-Shanghai-Bluemix-Meetup/events/218631968/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":14400000,"name":"Public Bluemix Meetup for Developers","time":1416459600000,"updated":1416474848000,"status":"past","group_id":15466482,"group_name":"IIC Shanghai Bluemix Meetup","lat":0,"lon":0,"city":"Shanghai","country":"cn","_id":"218631968"},{"utc_offset":32400000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1415859287000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"IoT (モノのインターネット）について語り合います。\n\nRaspberry Piなどのデバイスとアプリの連携をされている方、ビジネスにしようとしている方、興味のある方、お集まりください。\n\nデバイスと連携させたアプリやその作り方などについて情報共有を行います。\n\n自身の経験を発表いただける方も大歓迎です。\n\n奮ってご参加ください。\n\n*参加希望の方は、右上の Join and RSVPをクリックして参加表明ください。","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Tokyo-PaaS-and-Bluemix-Meetup/events/218656760/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"IoT（モノのインターネット）アプリを経験しよう","time":1416477600000,"updated":1416488542000,"status":"past","group_id":16453302,"group_name":"IBM Bluemix Meetup Tokyo","lat":35.654144,"lon":139.70555,"city":"Tokyo","country":"jp","_id":"218656760"},{"utc_offset":28800000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1416453043000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/IIC-Shanghai-Bluemix-Meetup/events/218792264/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":5400000,"name":"Public Bluemix Overview, Demo and Architecture","time":1416495600000,"updated":1416501361000,"status":"past","group_id":15466482,"group_name":"IIC Shanghai Bluemix Meetup","lat":0,"lon":0,"city":"Shanghai","country":"cn","_id":"218792264"},{"utc_offset":-7200000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1414949380000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":4.5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Montevideo-PaaS-Bluemix-and-Cloud-Computing-Meetup/events/217154042/","yes_rsvp_count":16,"duration":7200000,"name":"Bluemix en TechMeetup","time":1416517200000,"updated":1416540693000,"status":"past","group_id":15581002,"group_name":"Montevideo PaaS, Bluemix & Cloud Computing Meetup","lat":-34.903809,"lon":-56.190594,"city":"Montevideo","country":"uy","_id":"217154042"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1415039607000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"OpenEdx is the open-source release of the edX platform developed by the non-profit organization founded by Harvard, MIT, and other respected institutions.

By automating the steps of data access and refinement, predictive analysis and visual storytelling, Watson Analytics immediately identifies and explains hidden patterns and relationships to accelerate your understanding of why things happened and what's likely to happen.\n\nBecause Watson Analytics features natural language dialogue, you can ask the right questions and get results in the familiar terms of your business. Just as the first spreadsheet made financial calculations easier for anyone with a PC, Watson Analytics opens up the world of advanced analytics to all business users on the cloud.\n\nWatson Analytics offers self-service capabilities to the full range of business users and experts alike:\n\n• Individual Business Users, like sales operations, marketing programs managers, financial analysts or operations managers, who are looking to better understand the data relevant to their job roles.\n\n• Business Analysts, whose jobs are centered around processing information for the organization, and who want to go beyond measuring and start understanding, but don’t have ready access to advanced analysts such as data scientists, statisticians, data miners or BI architects.\n\n• Data Scientists themselves who can spend 40–80% of their time on data access and refinement. Watson Analytics can be an accelerator for them.\n\n• IT, who can deliver improvements in productivity to business users without having to support multiple solutions, ungoverned data sources or rogue data analysis projects.","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/BDU-Vancouver/events/217580002/","yes_rsvp_count":65,"duration":5400000,"name":"IBM Watson Analytics","time":1417746600000,"updated":1417757220000,"status":"past","group_id":14279512,"group_name":"Vancouver - Big Data University Meetup","lat":49.282818,"lon":-123.110016,"city":"Vancouver","state":"BC","country":"ca","_id":"217580002"},{"utc_offset":14400000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1416233302000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Программа:\n\n• Начало, сбор гостей: 17:00\n\n• Обзор платформы Bluemix, демо разработки сервиса на node.js\n\n• Портирование существующих Java EE приложений\n\n• Watson services\n\n• Неформальное обсуждение\n\nКак нас найти:\n\nСтанция м.

I’ve worked in the Netherlands, my home country of the UK and in Canada on a range of topics in the field of Bioscience and medical research for the past few years. Most of these involved ‘data munging’ to interface pre-existing tools and packages to my own software or filtering strategies. Quite quickly I became interested in Data Management: better management = less munging &amp; better results with less pain. I have spent a lot of my time more recently assisting with the storage, transfer and security of the newer ‘Genomics’ data – specifically resulting from High Throughput DNA Sequencing - between international databases or consortia. My current roll is that of ‘Automation Engineer’ – aka. ‘Data Manager’ – at the OICR.

Two topics will be covered:\n\nTopic 1: Semi-automated human genome annotation\n\nAbstract: Sequence census methods like ChIP-seq now produce an unprecedented amount of genome-anchored data. We have developed an integrative method to identify patterns from multiple experiments simultaneously while taking full advantage of high-resolution data, discovering joint patterns across different assay types. We apply this method to ENCODE chromatin data for multiple human cell types, including ChIP-seq data on covalent histone modifications and transcription factor binding, and DNase-seq and FAIRE-seq readouts of open chromatin. In an unsupervised fashion, we identify patterns associated with transcription start sites, gene ends, enhancers, CTCF elements, and repressed regions. The method yields a model which elucidates the relationship between assay observations and functional elements in the genome. This model identifies sequences likely to affect transcription, and we verify these predictions in laboratory experiments. We have made software and an integrative genome browser track freely available (http://pmgenomics.ca/hoffmanlab/proj/segway/).\n\nSpeaker: Michael M. Hoffman (Assistant Professor in the Departments of Medical Biophysics and Computer Science, University of Toronto)\n\nTopic #2: Deep Autoencoder Neural Networks for Gene Ontology Annotation Predictions\n\nAbstract: The annotation of genomic information is a major challenge in biology and bioinformatics. Existing databases of known gene functions are incomplete and prone to errors, and the biomolecular experiments needed to improve these databases are slow and costly. While computational methods are not a substitute for experimental verification, they can help in two ways: algorithms can aid in the curation of gene annotations by automatically suggesting inaccuracies, and they can predict previously-unidentified gene functions, accelerating the rate of gene function discovery. In this work, we develop an algorithm that achieves both goals using deep autoencoder neural networks. With experiments on gene annotation data from the Gene Ontology project, we show that deep autoencoder networks achieve better performance than other standard machine learning methods, including the popular truncated singular value decomposition.\n\nSpeaker: Davide Chicco (postdoctoral fellow at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University of Toronto)","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/BDU-Toronto/events/220871283/","yes_rsvp_count":31,"name":"Semi-automated human genome annotation","time":1425934800000,"updated":1426008396000,"status":"past","group_id":13393172,"group_name":"Toronto - Big Data University","lat":43.659801,"lon":-79.388748,"city":"Toronto","state":"ON","country":"ca","_id":"220871283"},{"utc_offset":19800000,"headcount":23,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1425541829000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Agenda - http://www-304.ibm.com/events/idr/idrevents/detail.action?meid=20741&amp;ieid=13546\n\nRegistration - http://www-304.ibm.com/events/idr/idrevents/register.action?meid=20741&amp;ieid=13729\n\nCloud computing enables you to overcome the capital requirements of Hadoop.

Watson mirrors the same cognitive process that we use every day to understand the world around us. With its ability to learn and navigate the language and protocols of specific professions and industries, and communicate in natural language, Watson is revolutionizing the way we make decisions, become experts and share expertise, at scale.\n\nIn September 2014, IBM announced IBM Watson Analytics, A self-service, cloud-based analytics solution powered by IBM’s Watson cognitive computing technology. It provides an easy way to quickly source data, discover insights, predict outcomes and visualize results. We shall explore it more in detail.\n\nWatson system is now made available to all developers in the form of services thru IBM Bluemix cloud platform. These services are collection of REST APIs and SDKs that can be used to build cognitive applications.

In this talk, we’ll highlight many of the mistakes we’ve seen people make when building a microservices architecture. We’ll discuss:\n\nWhen microservices are appropriate, and where to draw the lines between services.Dealing with performance issues (data affinity, parallelism, monitoring).Testing and debugging techniques.Managing a polyglot landscape and the explosion of platforms.Managing failure and graceful degradation. Tammer Saleh is a long time developer, leader, and author of the acclaimed book Rails AntiPatterns.\n\nAs founder of Thunderbolt Labs, he helped San Francisco companies build agile teams and ship scalable products. As VP Engineering at Engine Yard, Tammer ran the development team and the flagship Cloud product. Previous lives include C/C++ AI programming, as well as UNIX administration for Citysearch.com and Caltech’s Earthquake Detection Network.\n\nTammer is currently building the Cloud Foundry platform at Pivotal. You can read more about him at http://tammersaleh.com.\n\nDeploy the universe using BOSH\n\nBOSH was originally developed as a deployment tool for Cloud Foundry’s Elastic Runtime, but is also a general purpose configuration solution. BOSH powers Pivotal’s production Cloud Foundry deployment supporting thousands of applications, and a growing number of deployments of Kubernetes, Cassandra, MySQL, RabbitMQ and many other popular services. This presentation will demo the power of BOSH and give you an introduction to BOSH, so that you can get started with BOSH as well.\n\n* Introduction about BOSH * Deploy a service to BOSH\n\n* What is BOSH doing under the hood.","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/CloudFoundry-Munich/events/220877319/","yes_rsvp_count":49,"name":"2nd CF Meetup featuring Bosh and Microservices","time":1427133600000,"updated":1427463554000,"status":"past","group_id":18225255,"group_name":"CloudFoundry Munich","lat":48.150356,"lon":11.547068,"city":"München","country":"de","_id":"220877319"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1426698856000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Blumixeros, en esta oportunidad tengo el agrado de invitarlos a que participen en el evento #TAEduca donde estaremos presente.

In this role, Peter works closely with electronics &amp; appliance makers, auto OEMs &amp; industrial manufacturers to assist them in defining IoT strategy and roadmap -- architecting cutting edge IoT solutions utilizing the latest cloud-based technologies such as MQTT, real-time streaming, voice, cognitive and analytics. Peter enjoys helping customers innovate with IoT &amp; Bluemix. Prior to the current job, Peter had been in the IBM WebSphere middleware group for 15 years, holding various positions in consulting, technical sales and sales, which equipped him with deep technical skills in Java EE, Integration, SOA, BPM, API and Mobile technologies.\n\nTom Luczak - Co-Founder/Chief Technology Officer of flowthings.io\n\nTom’s love affair with all things computing, hardware, and communications began in the mid-80's. His passion growing while soldering upgrades into floppy drives and \"enhancing\" modems and phone lines to get better speed on his dial-up CompuServe connection.\n\nWhat started as a passion grew into a career years later while serving in the U.S. Army as an Electronic Warfare and Signals Intelligence Specialist and Linguist. As a Technical Director at an overseas location, Tom specialized in multiple analytic disciplines and participated in the creation and evaluation of several national-level intelligence products. He also earned Adjunct Faculty status at the National Cryptologic School and both co-authored and taught highly technical courses in several subject areas, including analytics, reporting, astrodynamics, and advanced radio theory. In short, he had a geektastic time.\n\nA couple of years later, (before most had heard the phrase \"Internet of Things\") Tom met Eric, and they decided to found a company called \"Flow\" with the vision of realtime data sharing between disparate systems in an agile way. Since that first meeting in a diner in Gramercy, Tom has loved every second of building the flowthings.io team and technology to realize that vision. He especially enjoys how his role lets him play with some neat hardware, get his hands dirty with a soldering iron, and constantly be amazed at the terminal effect a bunch of 1's and 0's flowing through the internet can have on the physical world.\n\nIn addition to his work on flowthings.io, Tom is the proud father of three smaller and better versions of himself and lives in Brooklyn with his wife and two dogs. He enjoys live music, complicated tabletop games, perforating paper from extreme distance and the study thereof, and making plans for the fully self-sustaining domicile he intends to build.","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/nyc-bluemix/events/221189701/","yes_rsvp_count":123,"duration":12600000,"name":"Internet of Things (IoT) on IBM Bluemix","time":1429047000000,"updated":1432681015000,"status":"past","group_id":15104552,"group_name":"New York City Bluemix meetup","_id":"221189701"},{"utc_offset":28800000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1428995649000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"活动主题：云时代，你我同行 - Bluemix promotion活动时间：4月15日 周三 下午 08:00-10:00活动地点：郑州航空工业管理学院南区主办单位：IBM教育学院教育培养计划\n\n2014年6月底，IBM正式发布了具有划时代意义的新一代平台即服务(Platform As A Service, PaaS)云平台—Bluemix。这是IBM从私有云转向公有云战略中非常重要的一步！IBM Bluemix----迈向平台即服务公有云的华丽转身，会给IT界带来怎样的巨大创新？在这里，你既可以感受IBM Bluemix在平台即服务公有云的创新，更有机会亲身感受它的魅力。\n\n作为本土IT生态系统的重要角色，合作伙伴如何加入这场速度与激情并存的变革？如果您是公司云战略的决策者；如果您是技术方案（云计算、移动互联、大数据和社交等）的实践者；如果您是拥有创新想法和理念的初创者；\n\nIBM教育学院教育培养计划是一项创新性的计划，旨在通过与学院、大学的合作将数百万学生培养成更具有竞争力的信息 技术工作者。IBM教育学院教育培养计划基于IBM软件雄厚的技术背景，将广大软件企业和高校资源有机结合，打造一种 全新的人才培养模式。一方面，从知识体系更新、增强动手能力和培养学生职业素质几方面入手，帮助大学生提高就业竞 争力；另一方面，从构建良好行业生态系统出发，为广大本土软件企业提供寻找更多高素质人才的渠道，缓解现阶段人才信息沟通脱节的状况。\n\n诚挚的邀请你参加并期待你的光临!","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Beijing-PaaS-Bluemix-and-Cloud-Computing-Meetup/events/221832189/","yes_rsvp_count":1,"name":"云时代，你我同行 - Bluemix promotion","time":1429056000000,"updated":1429068871000,"status":"past","group_id":15426102,"group_name":"Beijing PaaS, Bluemix and Cloud Computing Meetup","lat":0,"lon":0,"city":"Zhengzhou","country":"cn","_id":"221832189"},{"utc_offset":28800000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1428995782000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"活动主题：云时代，你我同行 - Bluemix promotion活动时间：4月15 周三 下午 14:30-16:00活动地点：郑州航空工业管理学院东区主办单位：IBM教育学院教育培养计划\n\n2014年6月底，IBM正式发布了具有划时代意义的新一代平台即服务(Platform As A Service, PaaS)云平台—Bluemix。这是IBM从私有云转向公有云战略中非常重要的一步！IBM Bluemix----迈向平台即服务公有云的华丽转身，会给IT界带来怎样的巨大创新？在这里，你既可以感受IBM Bluemix在平台即服务公有云的创新，更有机会亲身感受它的魅力。\n\n作为本土IT生态系统的重要角色，合作伙伴如何加入这场速度与激情并存的变革？如果您是公司云战略的决策者；如果您是技术方案（云计算、移动互联、大数据和社交等）的实践者；如果您是拥有创新想法和理念的初创者；\n\nIBM教育学院教育培养计划是一项创新性的计划，旨在通过与学院、大学的合作将数百万学生培养成更具有竞争力的信息 技术工作者。IBM教育学院教育培养计划基于IBM软件雄厚的技术背景，将广大软件企业和高校资源有机结合，打造一种 全新的人才培养模式。一方面，从知识体系更新、增强动手能力和培养学生职业素质几方面入手，帮助大学生提高就业竞 争力；另一方面，从构建良好行业生态系统出发，为广大本土软件企业提供寻找更多高素质人才的渠道，缓解现阶段人才信息沟通脱节的状况。\n\n诚挚的邀请你参加并期待你的光临!","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Beijing-PaaS-Bluemix-and-Cloud-Computing-Meetup/events/221832199/","yes_rsvp_count":1,"name":"云时代，你我同行  - Bluemix promotion","time":1429079400000,"updated":1429091721000,"status":"past","group_id":15426102,"group_name":"Beijing PaaS, Bluemix and Cloud Computing Meetup","lat":0,"lon":0,"city":"Zhengzhou","country":"cn","_id":"221832199"},{"utc_offset":7200000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1426501989000,"rating":{"count":5,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"L'incubateur Le Village By CA nous fait l'honneur de nous recevoir pour ce 7ème meetup Bluemix Paris, et dont le thème portera sur le Big Data &amp; Analytics.

Cela vous permettra d'expérimenter sur place, et d'interagir avec nos démos éventuelles !\n\nAgenda\n\nDémarrage à 18h00 précise (Accueil à partir de 17h45) : Mot de Bienvenue, présentation des invités.\n\n1) \"IBM Bluemix n'est pas qu'une offre cloud publique, en tout cas plus maintenant : le Cloud Hybride par IBM Bluemix\". Par Erwan Maréchal et Jean-Yves Rigolet de IBM France Lab - 45 min\n\nAnnoncé lors d'IBM InterConnect en début de cette année 2015, le cloud proposé par Bluemix est une solution hybride offrant de nombreuses possibilités aux entreprises dans leur transformation digitale.\n\nCe nouveau type de cloud apporté par Bluemix annonce la suppression des barrières entre cloud publique et privé pour proposer un cloud unique reposant sur des parties publiques dans lesquelles les ressources sont partagées entre tous les utilisateurs, dédiées à un groupe d'utilisateurs ou une entreprise et même privées au sein d'une entreprise.\n\nImaginez dès lors avoir à votre disposition, non seulement une puissance de calcul quasiment illimitée et au plus près de chez vous, hautement sécurisée pour vous et même parfois uniquement pour vous, tout en ayant la possibilité de conserver chez vous ce dont vous ne voulez ou pouvez pas vous séparer. Bienvenu dans le monde du cloud Hybride selon Bluemix!\n\nDurant cette présentation, Erwan Maréchal, IBM Rational Europe SaaS &amp; Cloud Leader et Jean-Yves Rigolet, ingénieur de l'IBM France Lab au développement de Bluemix vous présenteront ce nouveau cloud qu'est Bluemix, son architecture hybride et comment vous ainsi que vos applications existantes et à venir allez pouvoir en profiter pleinement, que ce soit pour y déployer des applications d'entreprise ou bien même des jeux vidéos, mais également pour y piloter vos objets connectés, enfin et surtout pour innover et là, seule votre imagination pourra y trouver des limites.\n\n2) \"Les applications d’entreprise composées avec Bluemix et DreamFace apporte de l'agilité à votre entreprise\", par Susan Haimet et Olivier Poupeney, les créateurs de DreamFace. (30 min env)\n\nAprès une introduction par Olivier Poupeney sur comment DreamFace est arrivé dans le MarketPlace Cloud d'IBM et dans le catalogue Bluemix, Susan vous démontrera le potentiel de DreamFace couplé à une plateforme telle que Bluemix.\n\nQue vous développiez des applications entièrement nouvelles ou que vous modernisiez une application existante pour l’amener vers le cloud, DreamFace sur Bluemix peuvent vous aider à accélérer le développement des applications cloud d’entreprise.\n\nDans cette présentation, Susan Haimet, CEO de DreamFace Interactive, vous montrera à partir d'un exemple de modernisation d'une plate-forme de Logistique multi-modale et multi-canale (interfaces web et mobiles) avec DreamFace et Bluemix, et soulignera les principaux ingrédients favorisant l'agilité d'informatique de votre entreprise :\n\n- Une architecture dans le cloud performante et sécurisée\n\n- La construction de l’application par composition des services et de composants métiers réutilisables\n\n- La création d'une expérience utilisateur intuitive et moderne\n\nDreamFace est une plateforme de développement basée sur le cloud qui permet de composer des applications cloud et mobiles de classe entreprise – le développement se fait directement dans le navigateur avec une composition visuelle de requêtes et composants visuels pour un déploiement sur le Web ou Mobile avec facilité. Une équipe aux compétences mixtes peut produire des applications rapidement et facilement - combinant une interface utilisateur riche, et consommant toute API publique ou privée. DreamFace a été conçu pour les entreprises et respecte les standards cloud en matière d’architecture, de sécurité et d'évolutivité.\n\nDreamFace est bâtie sur des technologies open source comme AngularJS ou Node.js, qui ont fait le succès des applications Internet récentes. DreamFace ajoute des composants visuels prêt-à-l'emploi qui peuvent être connectés à pratiquement toute API (JSON / REST) directement ou via un routeur. La prolifération des API et leur utilisation transforme rapidement le métier et la conception des applications. La plupart des fournisseurs ont déjà publié les API de leur applications. DreamFace propose une fonction d’auto discovery des API à partir d’une URL pour créer les composants de type query, qui sont réutilisables, et peuvent consommer pratiquement n'importe quel service, API, données d'entreprise ou de médias sociaux, et composant Big Data pour créer une application cohérente et composite. L'utilitaire \"Lightning UI\" \"découvre\" automatiquement API disponibles et \"génère des« composants visuels données compatibles.\n\nLe Référentiel (repository) intégré permet la création d' «Enterprise Business Objects» associés aux éléments visuels, permettant la réutilisation des API à travers l'application. En outre, l'outil permet de créer une \"chorégraphie d’APIs\" pour répondre aux cas d'utilisation les plus complexes ainsi que \"le filtrage de l'API\" pour soutenir divers dispositifs ou différents contextes de consommation de l'API. Pour faciliter la création d'applications orientées API, DreamFace intègre avec les sources d'API comme IBM API de gestion et de BPM, ainsi que des hubs d'intégration tels que IBM Cast Iron direct, bus d'intégration et plus encore.\n\nDreamFace est disponible sur IBM Cloud Marketplace et comme un Service Bluemix ce qui favorise la consommation des services proposés dans le catalogue Bluemix ou du Cloud Marketplace d'IBM.\n\n3) Annonces Offres spéciales pour Etudiants (et professeurs) et Startups :\n\n• Etudiants (et professeurs), venez à ce meetup et découvrez comment obtenir un compte gratuit Bluemix de 6 mois (12 mois pour les enseignants) vous donnant accès à tous les services IBM gratuitement.\n\n• Etudiants : venez découvrir les offres IBM pour venir travailler au France Lab, et même déposer votre CV !\n\n• Startups : découvrez le programme d'accompagnement dans la création de votre startup, vous permettant entre autres de bénéficier jusqu'à 10000 dollars de consommation Bluemix par mois pendant 1 an !\n\n4) \"Networking\"\n\nEn cloture du meetup, nous vous proposons d'échanger en toute convivialité autour d'un verre. C'est l'occasion d'échanger, simplement !\n\nLieu de la rencontre\n\nCampus de l'Efrei est au 30-32 avenue de la République 94800 Villejuif.

Imagine if you could find new, related pathways in your data to make discoveries in a fraction of the time you could before. This is the power of what can be achieved with Cognitive Computing. Quick test, ask your phone “find anything but pizza restaurants”. Did you get back a list of pizza restaurants? Think about how we’ve been trained to keyword search. We have all been Google-fied &amp; we may not even know it. Humans adapt their language, one that predates machines, to the limitations of a system.\n\nIBM Watson, the cognitive technology that enhances, scales, &amp; accelerates human expertise. Watson's cognitive capabilities on Bluemix will enhance apps &amp; help developers realize ideas not possible with today's systems. Watson is not a machine that lets us talk to it. It’s bigger, and that’s why this is a historic moment for developers, businesses &amp; entrepreneurs. IBM is creating tools that can understand language, determine a personality portrait, expand concepts &amp; more. In this session we will discuss &amp; demo Watson Services on Bluemix &amp; how developers can now embed these into their apps for unprecedented cognitive power.\n\nSpeaker Bio\n\nSwami Chandrasekaran (@swamichandra) is as an Executive Architect and technical leader in the IBM Watson CTO Office. In this role, he sets &amp; drives the technical agenda for cognitive computing, and works with customers on building IBM Watson-based cognitive, analytics &amp; big data solutions. His team is also responsible for driving the technical strategy around domain adaptation of Watson for various solutions in key industries, such as healthcare, telecom, public sector and financial services.,\n\nPrior to his current role, Swami was the Chief Architect for IBM Software - Business Solutions. Under his leadership, his team worked with several customers in the areas of OSS/BSS transformation, Cloud Service Broker, Cloud Storefronts, Digital Media Supply Chain, Mobile Payments, Smart Metering, Real-time &amp; Contextual Campaigns. He has previous experience at Webify, KPMG, BearingPoint and Ericsson Research. He has holds a Masters in Electrical Engineering from UT Arlington and authored several books &amp; publications in the areas of natural language processing, data science, BPM, SOA and enterprise integration.\n\nSign up for Bluemix no-charge trial, here - https://ibm.biz/Meetup_Dallas","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Dallas-Bluemix-meetup/events/222366189/","yes_rsvp_count":38,"duration":7200000,"name":"Pub & Dinner topic: What will you build with Watson on IBM Bluemix?","time":1432162800000,"updated":1432171653000,"status":"past","group_id":14046252,"group_name":"Dallas Bluemix (CloudFoundry PaaS) Meetup","lat":32.952633,"lon":-96.818573,"city":"Addison","country":"US","_id":"222366189"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":38,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1431108273000,"rating":{"count":7,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Welcome IoT enthusiasts!

Alan Moran will be in town this week so I secheduled this talk.\n\nPlatform 9 has offered to join us with a talk about multi-datacenter Openstack. We will live stream his talk and host a Google Hangout immediately following.\n\n#1: Multi-Datacenter Cloud Foundry using BOSH\n\nCurrently, BOSH can only deploy Cloud Foundry on a single cloud. So how do you manage multiple, geographically deployments using different cloud providers? You'd have to install BOSH in each data center and use additional computing resources/team efforts to provide fault tolerance.\n\nAlexander Lomov &amp; Alan Moran of Altoros are extending the functionality of BOSH director and a building BOSH plug-in that will automate deployments to multiple clouds. In this session, they will share their experience so far.\n\n#2: \"OpenStack as a Single Pane Across Data Centers\"\n\nVirtualization and container technologies across different data centers create infrastructure silos; which can increase fragmentation of resources, duplication of content and reduce the efficiency of your infrastructure. In this talk, Roopak Parikh, VP of Engineering at Platform9 will illustrate how OpenStack can provide an effective single pane of management across multiple data centers and virtualization technologies\n\nAgenda:6:30pm Networking &amp; Online Warmup7:00pm Presentation - \"Multi-Datacenter Cloud Foundry using BOSH\" by Alan Moran of Altoros7:45pm Presentation - \"OpenStack as a Single Pane Across Data Centers\" by Roopak Parikh of Platform98:15pm Q&amp;A8:30pm Google Hangout9:15pm Wrap-up\n\nGoogle Hangout: 8:30pmTopics to be discussed in the hangout are:- Use cases for many clouds- How BOSH works with an IaaS- How BOSH can be improved to work with multiple clouds\n\nAbout the Speakers:\n\nAlan Moran, Cloud Foundry Architect, AltorosAlan Moran is a Cloud Foundry Architect at Altoros. He has provided Cloud Foundry consulting to a number of Fortune 500 companies. With a software engineering background and coming from the Ruby community, Alan has spent the last couple of years learning about and working with the Cloud Foundry platform.\n\nRoopak Parikh, Co-Founder and VP of Engineering, Platform9Roopak envisioned the technology powering Platform9, and now leads our Engineering wizards in the quest to realize this vision. Before co-founding Platform9, Roopak was a technical lead at VMware, where he helped architect and ship major vSphere products: Update Manager and vCloud Director.\n\nBefore VMware, Roopak was a founding engineer at an early stage Mobile computing startup. Roopak's dream would be to combine his long-standing love for functional programming with his affection for container technologies.Outside of work, Roopak enjoys reading up on new technology, catching up on sports and movies, and keeping up with his son on the Soccer field.","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/CloudFoundry/events/220900433/","yes_rsvp_count":77,"name":"Multi-Datacenter with Cloud Foundry and OpenStack","time":1432258200000,"updated":1432270368000,"status":"past","group_id":2683612,"group_name":"Silicon Valley Cloud Foundry User Group","lat":37.377972,"lon":-122.032654,"city":"Sunnyvale","state":"CA","country":"us","_id":"220900433"},{"utc_offset":25200000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1431657760000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Registration : 10 April 2015- 19 Mei 2015\n\nSpeaker:\n\nDenny Muktar(IBM Solution Acrhitect)\n\nRizkiana Novitasari(IBM Client Technical Professional)\n\nRegistration fee :\n\n-Binusian: Rp[masked]\n\n-Non binusian: Rp[masked]\n\nBenefit: Certificate and Snack\n\n*Notes: Limited seat for 60 only!\n\nPlease contact below person for registration:\n\nFor registration and more info, please contact :\n\n1.

Pourquoi une seconde session sur ce thème ? Premièrement pour approndir ce sujet si passionnant et qui est en train de révolutionner le monde. Deuxièmement, pour vous montrer toutes les démos que nous ne pouvions pas faire en mode web conférence le 11 février dernier. Cette session permettra à tous de découvrir le thème, mais aussi de l'approfondir, et sera bien sûr consacré à découvrir les outils associés disponibles sur la plateforme Bluemix et Internet of Things Foundation, qui vous permettront d'accélérer vos projets Internet des Objets.\n\nDécouvrir Bluemix : le plus simple, c'est de venir avec son laptop ou tablette et de créer un compte gratuit pendant 30 jours en sans CB en 2 min ! Cela vous permettra d'expérimenter sur place, et d'intéragir avec nos démos Internet of Things !\n\nAGENDA\n\nAccueil des participants à partir de 17h45. Début à 18h00 précise.\n\n1) Introduction \"De l'Internet des Objets 1.0 à l'Internet des Objets 3.0\" par Michel Teyssedre, CTO IBM France (Chief Technical Officer)\n\n2) 2013 était l’année d’exploration pour les acteurs, et 2014 fût l’année d’organisation de l’écosystème de l’Internet des Objets. Acquisitions, alliances et annonces de plates-formes ont fait de l’année 2014 l’année charnière pour l’organisation de l’écosystème de l’Internet des Objets. Quels sont les consortiums de standardisation qui se sont constitués en 2014 ? Quelles sont les plates-formes annoncées en 2014 et qui vont structurer le marché pour 2015 ? Speaker : Marlène Séif, Master Cloud, ISEP (Institut Supérieur d'Electronique de Paris)\n\n3) Villes intelligentes. L'Internet des Objets (IoT) permet dans de nombreux secteurs de relier le monde physique au monde numérique au delà de l'historique Supply Chain, comme par exemple avec les voitures connectées, les bâtiments intelligents, les villes intelligentes (Smarter Cities) et la Santé. Des illustrations et la démonstration de l'intégration rapide dans le Cloud (Bluemix) de capteurs via des micro-contrôleurs (Raspberry Pi, Arduino, mbed ...) permettra de concrétiser la compréhension de la chaîne de bout-en-bout : de la mesure physique aux systèmes cognitifs. Speaker : Christophe Didier, IoT, Mobile and Smarter Cities, Technical Leader France - Executive Architect - MBA\n\n4) Démonstration Domotique : développer votre solution de surveillance avec un raspberry Pi et Bluemix, simplement. Yves Holvöet, Spécialiste Bluemix en France, vous expliquera comment il a développé cette solution, avec démo à l'appui, et vous donnera l'intégralité des informations pour le refaire chez vous !\n\n5) Démonstration pratique sur l'Internet of Things Foundation (Cloud IBM pour l'Internet des Objets) au travers d'un jeu multi-joueurs développé en JavaScript et basé sur des avions connectés. La démo présente la création d'une application \"Internet des Objets\" dans Bluemix, l'enregistrement et la connexion via MQTT des avions (objets) et d'une application mobile (contrôle des avions) de manière sécurisée (TLS) sur l'IoT Foundation. Speaker : Joël Gauci, Certified IT Specialist - Pan-IOT - IBM Connectivity Appliances &amp; API Mgmt.\n\n19h30 - Networking : des idées pour la communauté ou des questions pour un projet, rester discuter avec nos experts.\n\nNB : l'agenda étant très dense, l'accueil des participants commencera à partir de 17h45 et la session démarrera à 18h00 précise.

We have a great speaker: Chip Childers, Technology Chief of Staff, Cloud Foundry Foundation.\n\nTitle: The Makings of a Modern Application Architecture\n\nIt wasn’t too long ago that artisans, bathed in the glow of molten metal, forged parts that would go on to make up bigger, more powerful machines. Today, we call those artisans developers. Instead of metal, they use bits and bytes in the cloud to forge a modern application architecture that supports public, private and hybrid application deployment. One that enables users and developers to move their applications wherever they need to go. And it’s built on a growing, vibrant ecosystem.\n\nNowhere is this epic shift in how things are made more visible than the meteoric adoption of Cloud Foundry. In this talk, Cloud Foundry technology chief of staff Chip Childers will give attendees an inside look at the economic forces that have made Cloud Foundry the fastest growing open source project in history.\n\nHe will also provide a look at the technologies driving this new level of efficiency for application developers (tech like containers, Docker, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Cloud Foundry and social coding tools like GitHub). And he’ll explain why many prominent members of the Fortune 500 are building their futures on this modern application architecture.\n\nSpeaker: Chip Childers, Technology Chief of Staff, Cloud Foundry Foundation","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Area-Cloud-Foundry-Meetup/events/222987928/","yes_rsvp_count":43,"name":"The Makings of a Modern Application Architecture","time":1434058200000,"updated":1434112561000,"status":"past","group_id":10702282,"group_name":"The Boston Area Cloud Foundry Meetup","lat":42.364799,"lon":-71.088791,"city":"Cambridge","state":"MA","country":"us","_id":"222987928"},{"utc_offset":28800000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1434004646000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"互联网+背景下，企业移动战略与移动应用创新主题沙龙\n\n详细日程请见：http://42.121.110.91:7101/Survey/bjwors.html报名注册地址：http://42.121.110.91:7101/Survey/bjwors.html","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Beijing-PaaS-Bluemix-and-Cloud-Computing-Meetup/events/223171694/","yes_rsvp_count":1,"duration":11700000,"name":"企业的APP还能活多久？-- IBM探索企业移动成熟度与应用创新","time":1434087000000,"updated":1434100333000,"status":"past","group_id":15426102,"group_name":"Beijing PaaS, Bluemix and Cloud Computing Meetup","lat":0,"lon":0,"city":"Beijing","country":"cn","_id":"223171694"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1432907075000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"On June 12th, at The Frontier, a co-location space on Park Offices Drive in RTP, we will host an all-day event open to anyone interested in going deeper with Bluemix.

In days past it might take weeks or months to create an app. With IBM's new Bluemix cloud based Platform-as-a-Service, software developers can now build apps in hours or days rather than in weeks or months.\n\nIn cooperation with Cube and Bio-AM, IBM invites you to participate in a Bluemix \"Code Jam\" from 5 - 8 pm on June 15. The event will be held at the Cube at 328 S. Broadway in Rochester. Come learn about Bluemix, IBM's new cloud development platform. As part of this code jam you will be able to learn the fundamentals of building and deploying your application in the Cloud.\n\nIn the Jam we will have a number of ideas, but if you have been thinking of an app you would like to create and are willing to share it with the event community then please send us your idea. Maybe you have an idea of a new way to use social data, or a cognitive computing idea, or something related to Internet of Things. Whatever it might be, let us know and we may use them for the event. Please submit your idea by sending a Meetup message or email directly to Matt Paschal ([masked]).\n\nLeveraging IBM Bluemix, you can take your idea or problem, design it, and create it all in the cloud. IBM experts will be on hand to help coach you in how to use Bluemix to create your applications.\n\nIf you would like to try out IBM Bluemix before the Jam, you can sign up here: ibm.biz/Rochester_Meetup.\n\nRemember to bring your laptop, because we will be doing live coding.

The gold standard for business strategy for many years was “sustainable competitive advantage” - capturing a market or niche through and then extending that advantage. Companies following this script are going out of business. Those companies who have thrived through the shifts in human behavior resulting from the digital revolution are using a different script: focus on continuous innovation.\n\nContinuous innovation is a core set of corporate practices that involve strategy leadership and operational iteration; it includes continuous reconfiguration, options valuation, healthy disengagement, but, above all, building an innovation proficiency.\n\nIn the frame of digital transformation, the innovation proficiency is what we must envision and practice. The leading edge of this practice is pairing “cloud native applications” with “continuous delivery of business value,” as pioneered by Amazon and Netflix, and now demonstrated by many others including Allstate, GE, and Lockheed Martin.\n\nCloud native applications are run in the cloud and on myriad input and output devices, built from scratch with assumptions of mobile and IoT clients. These also use information and processes from legacy systems (“systems of record”) but do so in a way that protects rather than exposes them; cloud native applications should run against a “digital platform”.\n\nContinuous delivery of business value is the right-sizing of digital innovation. Like the lean manufacturing movement in Japan, it shrinks the size of the tools and team to focus on cycle time optimization rather than volume of production. There are two key dimensions: people and tools. The people dimension is realized by creating 8-10 person groups that break silos with members of every type of organization on a single team.\n\nThese people and tools come together to build a stack of practices: continuous integration, continuous deployment, and continuous innovation - a system in which collective experience across the team and its customers is rapidly iterated to deliver more business value with each turn of the cycle.\n\nThese practices appear to be an empirically demonstrated pattern for successful digital transformation: continuous innovation supported by an enterprise digital platform.","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Area-Cloud-Foundry-Meetup/events/223460141/","yes_rsvp_count":57,"duration":7200000,"name":"Continuous Innovation and Digital Platforms- Speaker: Sam Ramji","time":1436479200000,"updated":1436565527000,"status":"past","group_id":10702282,"group_name":"The Boston Area Cloud Foundry Meetup","lat":42.364799,"lon":-71.088791,"city":"Cambridge","state":"MA","country":"us","_id":"223460141"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","created":1433786528000,"rating":{"count":4,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"The topic is clustering algorithms, a major subcategory of machine learning used to divide data into groups (clusters).\n\n- what is clustering?\n\n- how does it differ from classification?\n\n- what are the applications of clustering?\n\n- how does clustering work?\n\nThe \"hands-on\" part:\n\n- how do we perform clustering in Python?\n\nBefore the Meetup:\n\n- Register for Data Scientist Workbench, a tool that lets you use Python or R in the cloud in an interactive GUI.\n\nhttps://datascientistworkbench.com/\n\nOn the day of the Meetup (July 9):\n\n- If you cannot attend, un-RSVP to open up a spot!\n\n- Bring your own laptop\n\n- Free Wifi!\n\n- Materials at: http://ibm.biz/analyticsmaterials\n\nAgenda:\n\n6:00pm - 6:15pm: Introduction (Raul Chong)\n\n6:15pm - 8:00pm: Presentation &amp; Hands-on sessions\n\nFree Pizza and Drinks!\n\nCome learn, eat, and socialize!\n\n75-person limitation, due to venue restrictions.

Spreadsheets offer entry level interface to the data but are time consuming and don’t scale, while languages like R or Python offer flexibility but have a steep learning curve for the non technical person.\n\nDomain experts need powerful yet easy-to-use interfaces to explore new data sets, normalize them and process them via innovative services often available via an API only. OpenRefine offers the best of both worlds with a self service agile and iterative interface for data discovery and preparation and an easy-to-learn scripting language.\n\nOpenRefine (formerly Freebase Gridworks and Google Refine) is a five year old project that has gained traction with various domain experts including librarians and researchers, data journalist, open data enthusiasts, and semantic web professionals.\n\nPresenter: Martin Magdinierhttps://ca.linkedin.com/in/magdinier/en\n\nOn the day of the Meetup (July 23):\n\n- If you cannot attend, un-RSVP to open up a spot!\n\n- Bring your own laptop\n\n- Free Wifi!\n\n- Materials at: http://ibm.biz/analyticsmaterials\n\nAgenda:\n\n6:00pm - 6:15pm: Introduction (Polong Lin)\n\n6:15pm - 8:00pm: Presentation &amp; Hands-on sessions (Martin Magdinier)\n\nFree Pizza and Drinks!

Speaker: Phil Estes\n\nThe ability to use the Linux kernel \"user namespaces\" feature in Docker has long been a hot topic with lots of interest from the community on when it would be made available. The good news is that we are currently finishing up the work for user namespaces and hope to make it available in Docker 1.9. Phil will go over the technical details of the initial implementation, how users will be able to use the added security provided, and what our future plans are for adding additional user namespace capabilities over time.A Docker image walks into a Notary Speaker: Diogo MónicaSecure software distribution is a hard problem. A testament to this fact are the thousands of different software update systems in use today, most of which vulnerable to a myriad of attacks that leave the end users potentially vulnerable to compromise.With the explosion in popularity of containers, more and more software is being distributed in the form of a Docker image. This gives us the unique opportunity to leapfrog the status quo, and create a better way to ensure the security of software distribution.Enter Notary, an application built at Docker that aims to make the internet more secure by making it easy for people to publish and verify content. Notary follows a flexible security framework called TUF (The Update Framework), allowing publishers to sign their content offline and manage their keys securely.In this talk I will go over Notary, its security guarantees, TUF and how we've integrated it into Docker 1.8 to provide content trust.","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/SeattleCloudFoundry/events/224609062/","yes_rsvp_count":10,"name":"X-Post- Docker Seattle: Developer Driven Infra, Namespaces, Security, Notary","time":1439946000000,"updated":1439959702000,"status":"past","group_id":14341562,"group_name":"Seattle Cloud Foundry Meetup","lat":47.609005,"lon":-122.334396,"city":"Seattle","state":"WA","country":"us","_id":"224609062"},{"utc_offset":7200000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1438085789000,"rating":{"count":2,"average":4.5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"IBM Innovation Space, at JoziHub\n\nJoin us at JoziHub for the kickoff celebration of the IBM Innovation space.\n\nIBM experts will provide technology and business mentoring and education at the IBM Innovation Space on a regular basis.\n\nDevelopers and entrepreneurs get easy access to IBM experts to discuss ideas, network with Cloud enthusiasts, and work side-by-side with IBM Cloud technical experts.\n\nCome join us for lunch, and to learn more about how IBM can help your startup.\n\n10am to 12pmOpening Speech\n\nIBM Global Entrepreneur Programme\n\nIntroduction of IBM Office Hours at JoziHub\n\nNetworking Lunch","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/SA-Bluemix-Meetup/events/224229393/","yes_rsvp_count":48,"duration":7200000,"name":"IBM Innovation Space Launch at JoziHub","time":1439971200000,"updated":1440040628000,"status":"past","group_id":16889682,"group_name":"South Africa Bluemix Meetup","lat":-26.204103,"lon":28.047304,"city":"Johannesburg","country":"za","_id":"224229393"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1436890450000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Join our August Bluemix meet up for a DevOps night.\n\nIBM® Bluemix™ DevOps Services is software as a service (SaaS) on the cloud that supports continuous delivery.

In days past it might take weeks or months to create an app. With IBM's Bluemix cloud based Platform-as-a-Service, software developers can now build apps in hours or days rather than in weeks or months.\n\nIn cooperation with the Mayo Clinic Business Accelerator (MCBusAccel), IBM invites you to participate in a Bluemix Meetup from 5 - 7 pm on Sept. 15. The event will be held at MCBusAccel at 221 1st Avenue SW Suite 202 in Rochester. Come learn about Bluemix, IBM's new cloud development platform. As part of this Meetup you will be able to learn the fundamentals of building and deploying an application in the Cloud.\n\nIf you have attended any of our previous Meetups at the Cube, UMR, RCTC, or IBM then you will benefit from this one by learning how to build on what you have already learned about Bluemix. For beginners, we will be offering a \"Starters Tutorial\" and for more experienced Bluemixers, we will have an \"Advanced Tutorial.\"\n\nAlso, if you have been thinking of an app you would like to create then you can try it out on Bluemix during the meeting. Maybe you have an idea of a new way to use social data, or a cognitive computing idea, or something related to Internet of Things. Whatever it might be, bring your idea and our experts can coach you in how to start coding it on Bluemix.\n\nTo start coding as soon as the Meetup starts, it will be important for you sign up for IBM Bluemix before the meeting here: ibm.biz/Rochester_Meetup. Doing this will help avoid the few minutes delay in the sign up process.\n\nRemember to bring your laptop, because we will be doing live coding.

Deploying Applications to the Cloud with Docker\n\nPresented by: Ryan Baxter, Developer Advocate - IBM Bluemix\n\nOur news feeds are full of stories talking about the failures and successes of companies that have moved applications to the cloud. Ultimately the consensus seems to be that moving applications to the cloud is a good thing, the next question is “how”? One solution that has taken the world by storm is Docker. While initially Docker seems promising, development and operations teams are often left with the problem of coming up with some type of Docker orchestration and management solution for deploying their applications. In this session we will get our hands dirty.\n\nWe are going to use IBM Bluemix to get your application to the cloud and leverage the power and portability of Docker containers.

Premièrement pour approndir ce sujet si passionnant qu'est Watson. Deuxièment, pour vous montrer des cas concrets dans le monde d'aujourd'hui, qui utilisent des services Bluemix Watson (des services production, pas en beta). Enfin, ce sera l'occasion de voir les nouveautés du catalogue Rubrique Watson, qui s'est fortement étoffé. (et ce n'est qu'un début, Bluemix vient de fêter ses 1 an d'existence !)\n\nVoici l'agenda que nous vous avons concocté pour vous donner une idée de qu'est Watson aujourd'hui, et de ce qu'on peut en faire concrètement et aujourd'hui ! Comme le dit très bien un ami, \"l'Intelligence Artificielle, ce n'est pas demain, mais c'est bien aujourd'hui que ca se passe\" !\n\nDécouvrir Bluemix : le plus simple, c'est de venir avec son laptop ou tablette et de créer un compte Bluemix sur http://ibm.biz/Meetup_Paris en 2 min !

As organizations begin to leverage more and more cloud capabilities and platforms, the notion of a hybrid cloud patterns becomes extremely relevant. Whether it be combining the privacy and control of a private cloud with an open cloud platform, or leveraging multiple public clouds, determining an integration strategy is critically important. Bluemix provides a number of services that help you address this requirement. In this session we will exam how to leverage the Secure Gateway service to integrate to an external cloud environment such as AWS or Microsoft Azure. Additionally, we make use of the Bluemix Cloud Integration capabilities to manipulate data in flight between multiple services.\n\nWe also welcome our Partner, Cintell who has their application running on AWS and they utilize IBM Watson Services on Bluemix to bring very specific , high value data science related functionality to their customers.

Everyone loves containers. HP Helion and Cloud Foundry provide more than just your standard container management platform. CF provides full application management, service management and is driven by leveraging the power of containers. For developers, containers can be created and managed automatically, or you can bring your own. Join us to learn how the Helion Development Platform uses containers and sandboxing (for native Windows support) to power the next wave of enterprise application innovation.\n\nAlvaro Peon-Sanchez is the Product Manager for the Cloud Foundry components in HP Helion Developer Platform. Alvaro has extensive experience developing software platforms and services. Alvaro is a computer systems engineer with an MBA from UC Berkeley. Alvaro loves to learn about software technologies and leverage it to unlock value to customers.\n\n• Pivotal Cloud Foundry pour DevOps : les rôles de Platform Ops et Application Ops (en Français)\n\nTout le monde s'accorde sur le fait que \"DevOps\" vise à réduire les points de friction entre le Dev et les Ops. Cloud Foundry propose une séparation des responsabilités \"opérations\" entre les \"opérateurs plateforme\" et les \"opérateurs d'applications\".Les Platform Ops sont responsables de maintenir la plateforme, sa sécurité, sa capacité et ses fonctionnalités transverses pour les développeurs et le maintien en condition opérationnelles. Les Application Ops sont garants de la disponibilité et de la performance des applications tout en étant très proches des projets, des développements et des livraisons - que ce soit sous la forme d'applications Spring, PHP, ... ou de containers tels que Docker dans Cloud Foundry. Les deux rôles sont des éléments clés dans l'agilité et la mise en place de DevOps à l'échelle de l'entreprise.\n\nMerci à Ippon qui sponsorise cette soirée ( http://www.ippon.fr/ )","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/CloudFoundry-France/events/225931070/","yes_rsvp_count":31,"name":"Cloud Foundry Summit + CF avec les containers (HP) + CF pour DevOps (Pivotal)","time":1446742800000,"updated":1447173476000,"status":"past","group_id":17920332,"group_name":"Cloud Foundry France","lat":48.875084,"lon":2.288394,"city":"Paris, 75016","country":"fr","_id":"225931070"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1444083548000,"rating":{"count":4,"average":4.25},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Please plan to join us at 5:30 PM for dinner and networking followed by our workshop!\n\nThis session will be a unique hands on workshop around Bluemix and hybrid cloud integration.

Examples would be something that measures (or even predicts) macro indicators like inflation, gdp, unemployment and manufacturing.\n\n2) Parse sentiment in financial news/social media text and/or video and image content on the web using Bluemix to create a sentiment based indicator that can measure and/or predict market direction.\n\n3) Analyze huge volumes of sec.gov data to perform real time fundamental analysis on companies using public filings using Watson. Insight should be useful in identifying undervalued stocks or short sale candidates. An offshoot project may involve scanning regulatory filings in real time and cross referencing options markets to create an indicator that could flag potential insider trading activity.\n\n4) Use Bluemix to create a polling tool that can be used to gather consensus opinion from alpha modus users about various topics like stock market direction, a stock's price or even a political election, a sporting event or new product release. Apply creativity in determining topics to poll. Then create an interactive real time visualization to display results of the poll.\n\nSuggested Bluemix APIs to Use:Alchemy APIConcept Expansion and InsightLanguage TranslationPersonality InsightsTrade Off AnalysisDataWorksInsights for TwitterPredictive AnalyticsStream AnalyticsData CacheSession cacheGeoCoding\n\nWrite your app in Node.js, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, Go or bring your own runtime.

The buzzword behind this is DOCKER. Although present for many years in cgroups, namespaces and LXC - container based virtualzation really took off as Docker Inc. brought this technology to the masses. Today, every 2nd IT startup is running on DOCKER. Enterprises and Academic institutions are slowly adapting as well. In this session we will learn what DOCKER really is, what Linux Kernel extensions are used and how you can use it in your environment. We will create a DOCKER image from scratch, add persistent storage to it and showcase a little cluster computing task using ApacheFlink and DOCKER-Compose. Finally I'll give you a short introduction to DOCKER on the cloud - currently offered by nearly every cloud service provider - and exemplified in the IBM Bluemix Platform Cloud.How to leverage cloud and analytics to capture real-time customer emotional insights\n\nTim Llewellynn, CEO and Cofounder\n\nnViso is a leading provider of emotion recognition software that interprets human facial micro-expressions and eye movements captured through video. Its solutions use 3D facial imaging technology with artificial intelligence to track hundreds of different facial points to recognize human emotions. The company combines the latest advancements in computer science, engineering and behavioral sciences to make automatic emotion recognition a viable reality using any image based device. Tim Llewellynn will present how his company uses IBM Watson Foundations, Softlayer and Analytics software to analyze digital emotional reactions from customers via the cloud and hence enable businesses to make better informed decisions and create more engaging and interactive experiences.\n\nIntroduction to Apache Spark\n\nHave you ever wondered how to develop a service and deploy it into the cloud? In this tutorial come join us and learn how to develop a service and integrate with other services on Bluemix, IBM’s award winning hybrid cloud development platform. IBM Analytics for Apache Spark is now opening up new avenues to develop next-generation analytics that combine the power of Spark with the rich set of data-centric Services available on Bluemix in new and innovative ways. The contents of this tutorial includes a deep dive and detailed code walk through of a sample application that does sentiment analysis on twitter conversations by integrating Spark streaming and Spark Twitter API with Watson Tone Analyzer Service. In this presentation, you’ll learn how to set up a local development environment for Scala using the SBT tool, how to package, deploy and run your Spark Streaming application on a Jupyter Scala Notebook on Bluemix and finally how to create compelling analytics and visualization’s using a IPython Notebook.\n\nWe’ll complete the tutorial with a discussion on the main Spark use cases and the architectural patterns to implement them.","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/HackSessionsSwitzerland/events/225441845/","yes_rsvp_count":25,"duration":10800000,"name":"Introduction to Docker, Streamcomputing on ApacheSpark and InfoSphere Streams","time":1447257600000,"updated":1447269881000,"status":"past","group_id":14151612,"group_name":"HackSessionsSwitzerland","lat":46.517075,"lon":6.562284,"city":"Lausanne","country":"ch","_id":"225441845"},{"utc_offset":28800000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1445925701000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"2015CIFC“互联网+”乌镇论坛将于11月12日在中国乌镇举行，活动将围绕“连接与共享、跨界与共赢”的主题，深入了解“互联网+”国家战略路径，交流探讨众创、众包、众扶、众筹的新模式、新机遇，共同创建“互联网+”共享平台与合作共赢体系，以“互联网+”“互联网金融+”打开大众创业、万众创新大门，创造企业与经济发展的新机遇、新模式、新引擎。\n\nIBM Smartcamp创业家全球训练营作为协办单位与组委会其他合作伙伴共同支持本次活动。\n\n活动议程11：30-13：00 午餐交流会CIFC理事&amp;乌镇“互联网+”俱乐部创始人交流午餐会13：00-13：30 嘉宾交流合作伙伴签约仪式嘉宾合影13：30-14：00 大会致辞主办方致辞领导致辞嘉宾致辞14：00-15：00 主题演讲互联网金融+ 中国经济新引擎互联网+ 国家战略之机遇大众创业万众创新之路15：00－15：15 互联网+ 启动仪式CIFC乌镇“互联网+”俱乐部成立仪式CIFC乌镇“互联网+”合作伙伴授牌&amp;揭牌仪式CIFC乌镇金融咖啡&amp;“互联网茶馆”创始股东授牌仪式CIFC乌镇互联网产业基金启动仪式CIFC“互联网+中国行”大型活动 启动仪式15：15－16：00 圆桌论坛：互联网+，创新创业中国梦主持人：淦南森 IBM GEP负责人拟邀对话嘉宾：袁岳 飞马旅创始人许单单 3W咖啡创始人刘成城 36氪创始人杨孝文 无微不至CEO、自媒体公社联合创始人柯 斌 众筹邦联合创始人、易筹网创始人16：00－16：50 圆桌论坛：互联网金融+，中国经济新引擎主持人：杨东 CIFC智库专家、中国人民大学法学院副院长拟邀对话嘉宾：计葵生(Gregory Gibb) 陆金所 董事长盛佳 网信金融CEO王思聪 翼龙贷董事长李玉瑛 宜信总裁助力康 文 易通贷COO朱明春 网贷之家联合创始人蚂蚁金服16：50－18：00 “互联网+”项目发布互联网+ 农业互联网+ 智慧城市互联网+ 汽车互联网+ 教育互联网+ 健康产业互联网金融+18：00 会议结束［注：大会日程及嘉宾安排以当日为准］\n\n参会对象：1、互联网、电子商务、新媒体、互联网金融企业创始人、CEO2、大中型金融机构相关负责人、投资机构创始人、合伙人3、创新企业董事长、总经理、创业家4、政府、行业协会、产业园区、众创空间等相关负责人5、知名新闻媒体、财经媒体负责人\n\n报名方式：因本次大会人数限制及安全要求，所有参会代表，全部采取注册审核制，符合参会条件的报名人员以报名缴费先后顺序确定参会资格。报名联系大会组委会秘书处：邮 箱：[masked]参会联系： 李在中[masked]嘉宾联系：陈俊彤[masked]咨询热线：[masked]","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Beijing-PaaS-Bluemix-and-Cloud-Computing-Meetup/events/226337473/","yes_rsvp_count":1,"duration":16200000,"name":"2015CIFC“互联网+”乌镇论坛","time":1447306200000,"updated":1447324227000,"status":"past","group_id":15426102,"group_name":"Beijing PaaS, Bluemix and Cloud Computing Meetup","lat":30.742695,"lon":120.487961,"city":"Tongxiang","country":"cn","_id":"226337473"},{"utc_offset":7200000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446195159000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"DevOps is an approach to application delivery that is helping teams deliver quality applications faster.

Spark is fundamentally shifting the way data and analytics are exploited by organizations by putting analytics into action where and when it is needed. With Spark, algorithms and big data models can be developed and built quickly with faster iterations enabling intelligence to be embedded into applications for web, mobile, social, Internet of Things as well as business process applications – enabling analytics to take a key role in the way an organization operates and makes decisions.\n\nIn this session we will explore the technology behind Spark, how it enables such fast processing, its ease of use in writing applications, and how it can combine different types of analytics such as SQL and machine learning seamlessly in the same application. In addition, we will look at Spark in the context of IBM Bluemix, which not only offers an integrated experience for data scientists and analysts to perform interactive analytics with Spark, but also enables Spark applications to take advantage of the wide range of services available on Bluemix.\n\nAgenda\n\n- Networking and dinner\n\n- Overview presentation highlighting capabilities\n\n- Demo's focused on Spark Python, Spark SQL, Spark R demos and more!\n\n- Discussion and Q+A\n\nStill haven't registered for your free Bluemix account?

The microservices architecture of Bluemix and the services it provides allows developers to focus on building and differentiating while consuming common services without building them from scratch.\n\nCognitive computing can be broken down into several sub-classes, like machine learning, natural language processing, reasoning and decision making, big data analytics, etc., allowing the system to learn, reason and engage in a more natural personalized way. Developers can now create smarter applications using a subset of these cognitive computing capabilities through services from Watson, reasoning on a corpus, and suggestion an answer that is “best” rather than “right”.\n\n+ Agenda :\n\n- 09:00am - 10:30 am : Overview of Bluemix Fundamentals – Architecture, Services and Examples\n\n- 10:30am - 12:00 pm : Overview of Watson Developer Cloud\n\n- 01:00pm – 02:30 pm : Lab Session 1: “Create and deploy a simple web/mobile application” using Bluemix.\n\n- 02:30pm – 04:00 pm : Lab Session 2: “Create and deploy a simple cognitive application” using Bluemix Watson services\n\n+ Instructor : Mr. Justin Lee (Evangelist from Asean IBM)","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Viet-Nam-Meetup-IBM-Cloud/events/226880442/","yes_rsvp_count":4,"duration":27000000,"name":"Hybrid Cloud Training Workshop","time":1447984800000,"updated":1448013235000,"status":"past","group_id":18595024,"group_name":"IBM Cloud Vietnam - Together We Change The World","lat":21.025379,"lon":105.843399,"city":"Hanoi","country":"vn","_id":"226880442"},{"utc_offset":19800000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1446051182000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"This is a free session for Java enthusiasts on Vaadin and Bluemix.\n\nAgenda of our First Session\n\n• Keynote on Java and Cloud Play by Mr. Rajesh J, Developer Advocate and CTO IBM Cloud Ecosystem India\n\n• Introduction to Vaadin\n\n• Vaadin Showcase\n\n• Vaadin Architecture\n\n• Road Map ahead\n\nRegistration is mandatory on our portal Bangalore Meetup to enter, attend, and access our premise for this meetup.\n\nAll the details pertaining to this session is also available on our Meetup page.\n\nURLs of our Meetup Page:-\n\n1. http://bangalore-meetup.mybluemix.net/\n\n2. http://meetupblr.mybluemix.net/","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/thebluemix/events/226373105/","yes_rsvp_count":33,"name":"Building a Web application using Vaadin Framework - 1","time":1448022600000,"updated":1448106547000,"status":"past","group_id":16261552,"group_name":"Bangalore Cloud Computing Group - The Bluemix™","lat":12.94549,"lon":77.639832,"city":"Bangalore","country":"in","_id":"226373105"},{"utc_offset":-18000000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1447946740000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"I'll be at the Frontier again tomorrow - probably last time for the year.

The microservices architecture, which is the basis of many new age distributed systems such as OpenStack, NetFlix and so on, is at the heart of Cloud Foundry - a complete developer-oriented Platform as a Service (PaaS) that is IaaS agnostic and supports vCloud, OpenStack and AWS.\n\nWe will discuss the microservices architecture, 12-factor app, containers, etc., and how to architect applications for the cloud in general and Cloud Foundry in particular. Attend this demo-oriented session in which we will cover the basics of Cloud Foundry. He will also cover many of the Non Functional Requirements (NFR), which is typically in the domain of the architect such as scaling, security and HA and how applications can leverage Bluemix for these.\n\nAfter attending this session, attendees will walk away with a better understanding of Platform as a Service and Cloud Foundry in general, and Bluemix in particular and how the ecosystem enables deploying applications to the cloud a lot easier. Attendees will also be able to understand how to enable logging, remote debugging, monitoring and so on by turning a few knobs in the platform.\n\nRaghavan Srinivas\n\nRaghavan \"Rags\" Srinivas (@ragss) works as an Architect/Developer Evangelist at IBM with a mission to help developers build highly scalable and available systems.

The buzzword behind this is DOCKER. Although present for many years in cgroups, namespaces and LXC - container based virtualzation really took off as Docker Inc. brought this technology to the masses. Today, every 2nd IT startup is running on DOCKER. Enterprises and Academic institutions are slowly adapting as well. In this session we will learn what DOCKER really is, what Linux Kernel extensions are used and how you can use it in your environment. We will create a DOCKER image from scratch, add persistent storage to it and showcase a little cluster computing task using ApacheFlink and DOCKER-Compose. Finally I'll give you a short introduction to DOCKER on the cloud - currently offered by nearly every cloud service provider - and exemplified in the IBM Bluemix Platform Cloud.\n\nNote: If available please bring your own laptop to the seminar.","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/HackSessionsSwitzerland/events/227288339/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":7200000,"name":"Introduction to Docker","time":1449666000000,"updated":1449674488000,"status":"past","group_id":14151612,"group_name":"HackSessionsSwitzerland","lat":46.951908,"lon":7.428583,"city":"Berne","country":"ch","_id":"227288339"},{"utc_offset":3600000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","created":1446635062000,"rating":{"count":10,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Ce 12ème meetup Bluemix aura lieu à l'école \"42\" et sera consacré au thème de l'Intelligence Artificielle. 2016 sera le début d'une ère cognitive de masse, où les premières IA sur le web naîtront et grandiront.

The goal is to get users to click on online ads, which ultimately generates revenue for the ad sponsors. This is a hard problem to solve, given the magnitude of combinations of users, webpages and ad sponsors. It is also a great success story for scalable Machine Learning. In this talk, we discuss the Kaggle competetion on click through rate prediction, which is an important metric for evaluating online ad performance. Using the dataset from Kaggle, we use Spark MLLib to create a pipeline for data parsing, feature extraction, model creation, model evaluation and finally prediction.\"\n\nPrerequisites / Level:This is an Intermediate level talk, where attendee is expected to know the basics of Spark and Machine Learning.\n\nWhat to Bring:Laptop (optional)\n\nMeet Your Speaker:Manisha Sule is a software engineer currently working with IBM's Spark Technology Center. She is a data science enthusiast with a passion for Machine Learning and Spark. After a Master's in Computer Science and building distributed and highly available software for the B2B industry, Manisha joined IBM Analytics with a focus on using Apache Spark to turn data into deeper insights. She also works to educate and enable IBM customers, data scientists and data engineers on Apache Spark.\n\nManisha is passionate about women in technology and children's education.\n\nTalk 2: How to Program Yourself Out of a Job: Machine Learning at DatafinitiAt Datafiniti, we transform content on web pages into highly structured data feeds on businesses, products, real estate, and more. Traditionally, this process has required extensive, human-driven development of web crawlers and scrapers, but as we continue to innovate, we're using machine learning to automate more and more extraction. For this talk, we'll provide a quick intro into our crawling and database architecture and then follow up with how we're using machine learning to dramatically scale our operations.\n\nPrerequisites / Level: The talk will range from beginner to intermediate topics. Exposure to web crawling and machine learning will help, but is not required. Meet the Speaker: Shion Deysarkar is the CEO &amp; founder of Datafiniti. Thanks to Sponsors:Special thanks to IBM for sponsoring food and drink for the evening and thanks to Datafiniti for hosting.

The goal of the Cloud Foundry Foundation is to build software intended for public, private and managed clouds and to enable DevOps on the cloud for speed, safety and security.\n\nModeled after the popular rendition of this tutorial at JavaOne 2015, this hands-on-tutorial will discuss the motivation behind PaaS, look at PaaS architectures and common functionality, and explore the integration points between PaaS and IaaS. Attend this session for a quick technical overview of Cloud Foundry and to be able to deploy a variety of applications on the platform that handle requirements such as HA, scaling, logging, monitoring, debugging, security, etc.\n\nThis session will be of value to developers, devops, systems administrators, and any IT decision makers.\n\nAfter attending this session you should be able to walk away with a good understanding of Cloud Foundry and how it enables cloud native and microservices architectures.\n\nWe will cover the following topics as short 12-15 exercises each about 8-10 mins. long.\n\nCloud Foundry internals and concepts\n\n* Exercise 1: [Target the Cloud Foundry Instance](ex1)\n\n* Exercise 2: [Push your application] (ex2)\n\n* Exercise 3: [manifest.yml and more CLI commands] (ex3)\n\n* Exercise 4: [Connect to a service] (ex4)\n\n* Exercise 5: [Scale your application] (ex5)\n\n* Exercise 6: [Health Monitoring] (ex6)\n\n* Exercise 7: [Draining logs] (ex7)\n\n* Exercise 8: [Blue/Green Deploy] (ex8) [Advanced]\n\n* Exercise 9: [Jenkins Integration](ex9) [Advanced]\n\n* Exercise 10: [Using the Eclipse IDE Plugin](exa) [Advanced]\n\n* Exercise 11: [Cloud Foundry App. Interoperability](exb) [Advanced]\n\n* Exercise 12: [Polyglot Adventures] (exc) [Advanced]\n\n* Exercise 13: [Microservices Adventures] (exd) [Advanced]\n\n* Tying things together\n\nPrerequisites\n\nPrerequisite 1: An active and current Bluemix account (trial Bluemix accounts are available at http://console.ng.bluemix.net and are typically valid for 30 days).

In some cases, even longer. The Cloud Foundry Foundation offers a unique approach to gaining committer in as little as six weeks, which we call the Cloud Foundry Dojo. The program is derived from the Pivotal labs Dojo program. It allows developers to master Cloud Foundry by working shoulder to shoulder on the open-source project with other Cloud Foundry engineers. Qualified engineers from the Cloud Foundry community can participate in pair programming with committers on a Cloud Foundry project team, gain invaluable experience with the core technology and the unique agile development environment, and make direct contributions to the codebase. Participation typically lasts 6-12 weeks.\n\n· Become part of the EMC Cloud Foundry Technical Community\n\n· Learn DevOps practices and culture\n\n· Accelerate your knowledge of the Cloud Foundry platform\n\n· Develop relationships with all the key contributors\n\n· Lead the next wave of innovation\n\nEMC's Cambridge-based Dojo will host software developers from EMC customers and partners, along with developers from EMC's own software engineering ranks. The facility itself is designed as an open shared environment that is purpose-built for software developers to write code together through the agile pair programming/TDD model. The facility will also host regular Meetups with the local Cloud Foundry community.\n\nPlease RSVP by Signing up for the Meetup","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Area-Cloud-Foundry-Meetup/events/227918919/","yes_rsvp_count":63,"duration":7200000,"name":"EMC Cambridge Dojo Opening Ceremony","time":1453489200000,"updated":1453578088000,"status":"past","group_id":10702282,"group_name":"The Boston Area Cloud Foundry Meetup","lat":42.364799,"lon":-71.088791,"city":"Cambridge","state":"MA","country":"us","_id":"227918919"},{"utc_offset":28800000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1452830512000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Calling all CEOs and CTOs of Startups, ISVs and SIs - come experienc the power and values of IBM Bluemix.

This data, generated by mobile devices, apps, sensors and wearable tech represents highly valuable information. Making accurate, real-time decisions with raw data to unlock its economic potential is now becoming crucial for countless businesses. Many organizations are still struggling to find out how to leverage the promise of big data.\n\nIn this session you will:\n\nexplore the technological challenges of big datafind the right infrastructure for your big data workloadsdiscover how to overcome the common pitfalls when using Cloud and NoSQL databases\n\nMining raw data can be gold to your business. Find out how you can exploit its value.\n\nThe session with IBM SoftLayer: John Easton, IBM Distinguished Engineer and Lead Cloud Advisor UKI and Nordics, will be the voice of IBM Cloud SoftLayer and his talk will cover:\n\nWe find ourselves in a data-rich world; having easy access to data from a multitude of different sources. Only a few years ago, very few companies could do this. Now everyone has the potential to exploit data from sources as varied as weather, sensor, social etc. Organisations relying on traditional data processing techniques will be unable to keep up, let alone take advantage of the new opportunities this opens up. A new approach is needed: one based around cloud and cognitive techniques. This session will use a variety of real client examples to show the art of the possible. To demonstrate how organisations bring these different data sources together and apply innovative analytical approaches using cloud platforms optimised for these problems to disrupt industries and create new business value.\n\nJohn Easton will give you his insights on the following: examples of IoT application in real world, from premature infants treatment, to energy and utilities industry (bridging the Weather Company story Manu from Basho will use), to transport why and what type of compute and network infrastructure is critical for those type of workloads, showcasing the readiness and the uniqueness of IBM Cloud SoftLayer with single tenant environment and robust low latency network NodeRED from Bluemix, that provides a browser-based flow editor that makes it easy to wire together devices, APIs, and online services by using the wide range of nodes in the palette cognitive computing with Watson awe-inspiring videos presenting application of all the presented technologies in production\n\nThe session with IBM Innovation: IBM Innovation will be joining this talk with a session on “IoT Sensor outlier detection in the cloud using dashDB and R”\n\nRomeo Kienzler, Data Scientist at IBM InnovationCenter will explore how to create predictive models for real-time IoT data analysis:\n\n'IoT mainly is seen as distributed data generation. In order to create valuable insights this data has to be stored for retrospective analysis to create predictive models for real-time analysis. In this talk we show how to stream mqtt data acquired through subscription to IoT sensors into a distributed relational database and how the IBM R accelerator is used to push down R code to SQL and stored procedures to react in real-time to changing sensor data'","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/HackSessionsSwitzerland/events/228279944/","yes_rsvp_count":8,"duration":10800000,"name":"Strategy & Tech Talk - From meters to pacemakers - the Internet of Things","time":1455210000000,"updated":1455221943000,"status":"past","group_id":14151612,"group_name":"HackSessionsSwitzerland","_id":"228279944"},{"utc_offset":-28800000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1430860214000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"IBM Cloud Office Hours: Have questions about building apps in the Cloud?

The processing of log mining aims to discover useful information, knowledge, and patterns from structures as well as unstructured logs. A log mining application is usually carried out in three main steps:\n\nPre-processing: The raw data is usually not suitable for mining due to various reasons. It may be messy, too large, and involve irrelevant attributes.Data mining: The processed data is then fed to a data mining algorithm which will produce patterns or knowledge.Post-processing: In many applications, not all discovered patterns are useful. This step identifies those useful ones for applications. Various evaluation and visualization techniques are used to make the decision.\n\nIn this webinar, we will go over each of these steps and analyze logs from a real-world application!Recommended for:\n\nData scientists and engineersDevelopers and technical team managersTechnical product managers\n\nWhat you'll learn:\n\nPre-processing tricks for working with messy log data.How to extract useful patterns and insights from unstructured logs.Make predictions about future events based on extracted patterns.\n\nWhat we’ll cover:\n\nUse time series analysis tools to munge log data.Extract useful patterns with frequent pattern mining algorithms.Learn rules and make predictions with association rule mining.\n\nIf the timing is not convenient, register to receive the recording of the session afterwards.","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Revealed-Austin/events/229048645/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"duration":3600000,"name":"Webinar: Pattern Mining: Extracting Value from Log Data","time":1456254000000,"updated":1456259333000,"status":"past","group_id":14364582,"group_name":"Big Data Revealed","_id":"229048645"},{"utc_offset":-21600000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455750497000,"rating":{"count":0,"average":0},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Join us for our first 2016 meetup in partnership with TechrIoT!\n\nWe are excited to bring back Doug Hohulin from Nokia, presenting: The Future 10X Network\n\nNokia acquired Motorola Networks 5 years ago and just acquired Bell Labs / ALU binging a history of 8 Noble Prizes including the Discovery of the Big Bang, Invention of the Transistor and Cell Phone Technology.

South side of Summer street, across from the old LMI building\n\nOne of our very own, Jonathan Kaufman, Developer Advocate for IBM Emerging Technology will be presenting at the February Node.JS Boston Meetup. He will be talking about Microservices in Node.js and is an expert in building awesome apps in Bluemix. Xively will be sponsoring and there will be plenty of food, beer, and wine on hand.\n\nI hope that you will be able to join us!---------------Dan Fields - Principal Software Engineer at Starry\n\nThe first in a series of talks on how to maximize your application's performance on Node.js and the V8 runtime. This talk will provide a brief overview of V8's optimizing compiler, why it's important, and how to avoid writing code that opts out of optimization.\n\nJonathan Kaufman - Developer Advocate for IBM Emerging Technology\n\nDismantling the Monolith: Building and Discovering Microservices in Node.js\n\nMicroservices seem to be all that anyone is talking about these days; long gone is the monolithic app. The idea is simple - take one large app and break it into a bunch of tinier apps that interact in a reliable and fault-tolerant way. This brings with it a new set of functional and technical challenges to overcome - how do these \"tiny apps\" communicate? How do they discover each other? How big is too big? In this talk, we will build a microservice-based architecture up from scratch, while discussing different design patterns and common pitfalls, all in Node.js.\n\nBio: Jonathan Kaufman is a Developer Advocate for IBM Emerging Technology currently residing in Cambridge, MA.

Exponentially increasing amounts of data (Volume) need to be processed to yield correct actions (Veracity). These new analytics applications must also be flexible in terms of deployment - employing a combination of cloud and on-premise resources as required to meet the needs of the business. This type of hybrid cloud, near real time analytic application requires streaming analytics capabilities, messaging systems and secure gateways to integrate cloud and on-premise systems. In this meetup, we'll walk through how to create such an application. Simulated sensor data will be pre-processed in a node.js cloud application, transported via TCP to an on-premise Apache Kafka messaging system over a secure gateway, and monitored and analyzed with a Spark Streaming application running on Hadoop. We will explore the various technology components used in this application as well as demonstrate how they integrate in an end-to-end application flow. We will also do a deep dive into the Spark Streaming application itself.\n\nAgenda:- Networking, pizza, soda and beer- Overview presentation covering the underlying technology components- Demo showing the various components of the application- Discussion with Q&amp;A","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Bluemix-Developers-in-Cambridge/events/228980411/","yes_rsvp_count":21,"name":"Hybrid solution analysis of streaming sensor data with Spark Streaming & Kafka","time":1458079200000,"updated":1458159438000,"status":"past","group_id":13926432,"group_name":"Bluemix-Developers-in-Cambridge","lat":42.349411,"lon":-71.050056,"city":"Boston","state":"MA","country":"us","_id":"228980411"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1455646083000,"rating":{"count":1,"average":5},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Registration:\n\nRSVPing to this meetup is not enough to attend.

So come to the Mad Scientists event at IBM Southbank for a rather special evening where IBM developers, members of the LJC and University researchers will be demonstrating a whole range of the latest software and tech. You’ll hear about personal projects, creations approach, the problems solved, the tech people have used. The flavour of the event will be more Tech Fair than conference or presentation, with a sharing of ideas and technologies.\n\nAmongst a wide range of talks and demonstrations we’ll be hearing from:\n\nDave Snowdon: Getting emotional about robots and clojure\n\nSocial robots have become a regular feature of tech news over the last couple of years. Whether it's talk about Dr Cynthia Breazeal's Jibo robot, Aldebaran's Pepper robot working as a shop assistant in Japan &amp; France or yet another robot platform being crowdfunded on indiegogo. But why should we care? Is a \"siri on wheels\" any better than a siri in the hand? Why would we want social robots to be emotional? This talk will skirt around some of these questions, deftly avoid mention of SkyNet and somehow show that clojure is the answer.\n\nBio: By day, a mild-mannered programmer working on Virtual Desktop Infrastructure at VMware. By night, when not asleep, plans world domination by social emotional robots powered by python and clojure. Before he was virtualised Dave worked for Xerox Research in France and, back in the mists of time, developed one of the first distributed multi-user virtual reality environments as part of his PhD work at Manchester.\n\nHolly Cummins (Talk title to be confirmed)\n\nWe are delighted to be able to include Holly Cummins in our speaker line up. Holly is well known to members of the LJC (her most recent talk to the community was Confessions of an Automation Addict) and she’s a leader in innovative technology. She is technical lead in IBM's Bluemix Garage London, and a committer on the Apache Aries project. She is a co-author of Enterprise OSGi in Action and has spoken at Devoxx, JavaZone, The ServerSide Java Symposium, JAX London, GeeCon, and the Great Indian Developer Summit, as well as a number of user groups.\n\nLaura Cowen : Ambient Kettle Project\n\nWhenever I boil my kettle to have a cup of tea in Hampshire my Mum, in Lancashire, gets a tweet. Sometimes Mum replies to that tweet to say that she's having a cup of tea too. It's the closest we can get to having a cup of tea together most of the time. It's this sense of 'ambient connectedness' that we tried to develop with the Ambient Kettle project. I'll talk through how it works and then how we tried to capture the essential aspects of boiling a kettle and making a cup of tea to create a physical representation of my kettle.\n\nBio: Laura is a developer advocate at IBM where she’s building the WASdev developer community around the Liberty Java application server. She previously worked in UX and technical writing during her 13 years at IBM. She gets involved in cool IoT projects for fun. Laura has a BSc in Psychology and a Masters in Human-Computer Interaction. She’s currently studying for a PhD in Psychology. She also presents on the Ubuntu Podcast on open source and technology, and has organised and volunteered at open source community conferences like OggCamp.\n\nAgenda:\n\nDoors open at 6:00 pm with talks and demonstrations until around 9:00 pm.\n\nVenue:\n\nBoyle, Darwin &amp; Fleming rooms, IBM Client Centre, 76/78 Upper Ground, South Bank, London SE1 9PZ\n\nhttp://www-05.ibm.com/uk/locations/sbnk.html\n\nDrinks and pizza will be available thanks to our sponsors, IBM.\n\nRSVP early to secure your place!","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/London-PaaS-Bluemix-Meetup/events/229340728/","yes_rsvp_count":16,"duration":10800000,"name":"Mad Scientists","time":1458842400000,"updated":1457098405000,"status":"upcoming","group_id":14354522,"group_name":"London PaaS & Bluemix Meetup","lat":51.506952,"lon":-0.111438,"city":"London","country":"gb","_id":"229340728"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1453231454000,"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Registration:\n\nRSVPing to this meetup is not enough to attend.

This is a fantastic opportunity to hear some great speakers on developing applications using APIs in these fast-growing technologies. See below to register. Here is a description:\n\n***********************************************************\n\nMicroservice architectures have emerged as the preferred way to engineer robust, scalable cloud-native solutions. They encapsulate application logic in small, loosely-coupled, distributed services communicating via language-agnostic APIs. Despite their benefit, microservice-based solutions remain difficult to build using mainstream cloud technologies, often requiring control of a complex toolchain, and separate build and operations pipelines. At this meetup, we will share our experiences and practices that work for us and have been incorporated into our methodology. We'll show you our open toolchain platform that allows developers to define and standardize their DevOps toolchains, by selecting, integrating, configuring and organizing the best of open, third-party and IBM technologies to deliver innovative applications using a DevOps methodology. And we'll show you examples of how we're doing this in the context of Apache Spark, an open source cluster computing framework optimized for extremely fast and large scale data processing, and our Watson cognitive APIs - services for adding natural language and machine learning processing to your applications.\n\n***********************************************************\n\nWe will do IoT next meetup, but don't miss this opportunity to get some in-depth technical insight!\n\nPlease use the LINK here to register for this event.","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Bluemix-Washington-DC-PaaS-and-Cloud-Computing-Meetup/events/228258853/","yes_rsvp_count":31,"duration":10800000,"name":"Spark and Cognitive Analytics","time":1459461600000,"updated":1456487341000,"status":"upcoming","group_id":19147905,"group_name":"Bluemix - Washington, DC PaaS and Cloud Computing Meetup","lat":38.927788,"lon":-77.236885,"city":"McLean","state":"VA","country":"us","_id":"228258853"},{"utc_offset":28800000,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1400563937000,"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"Tesla, BMW i8, they are very modern &amp; fashion to cars, not only a new car, also a revolution for automotive industry.\n\nBut, there is a big gap to such electronic cars, \"power provider\".\n\nLet's image, if those electronic cars can't get power as easy as fuel now for traditional cars, the revolution couldn't go further.\n\nIt will must be happened in the near future.
