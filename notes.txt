Day of the week:

    avg attendance to all of one particular meetup's events (15.6 people)

    avg attendance for one particular meetup each day of the week
    (Monday: 10.5 people, Tuesday: 12.2 people, Wednesday: 18.1 people, Thursday: 20.2 people,  Friday: 15.3 people)
    
    % below average for each day: (Monday -32.3%, Tuesday: -21.8%, Thursday: +16%)
    
    Wait... but how does this work with a group scheduling ALL their meetings on one day.... that would make it Thursday: 0%, when maybe a lot of people AARE going to that
    
    
    
Average these for ALL Groups to get average % below a group's average attendance


Calculate...------------------------------------------------

Groups:

Avg events per month (for last 6 months). avg_events_per_month_last_3_months

Avg attendance per events (in last 6 months). avg_yes_rsvps_per_event_last_3_months

Average participation rate. (Avg attendance per event in last 6 months / # of members in group). avg_participation_rate

Average parcipation rate each day of the week: (Avg participation on (M/T/W/Th/F) in last 6 months). avg_participation_rate_on_M(T/W/Th/F)

Average participation each hour of day: [Total : M: [0:, 1:, 2:, 3:, 4:]] (combine the last 3 things into one structure in the JSON with array for each hour of the day....? Or maybe that's too much data to crunch. Need to google)

*Make note that: Last 6 months is important, because I don't have historical growth data



Events:
Number of member's in the event's group: members_in_group
Heads up time for each event. (date - announcement date). heads_up_time
Participation rate for event (# of yes rsvps / # of members in the group's event). participation_rate //maybe not good because no historical growth data....
